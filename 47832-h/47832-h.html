        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Kalends
        (first) of March.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A brilliant day in
        the town of Nemausus—the modern Nîmes—in the Province of Gallia
        Narbonensis, that arrogated to itself the title of being <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the</span></span>
        province, a title that has continued in use to the present day, as
        distinguishing the olive-growing, rose-producing, ruin-strewn portion
        of Southern France, whose fringe is kissed by the blue
        Mediterranean.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Not a cloud in the
        nemophyla-blue sky. The sun streamed down, with a heat that was
        unabsorbed, and with rays unshorn by any intervenient vapor, as in
        our northern clime. Yet a cool air from the distant snowy Alps
        touched, as with the kiss of a vestal, every heated brow, and
        refreshed it.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Alps, though
        invisible from Nemausus, make <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page2">[pg
        2]</span><a name="Pg002" id="Pg002" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>themselves felt, now in refreshing breezes, then
        as raging icy blasts.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The anemones were
        in bloom, and the roses were budding. Tulips spangled the vineyards,
        and under the olives and in the most arid soil, there appeared the
        grape hyacinth and the star of Bethlehem.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the back of the
        white city stands a rock, the extreme limit of a spur of the Cebennæ,
        forming an amphitheatre, the stones scrambled over by blue and white
        periwinkle, and the crags heavy with syringa and flowering
        thorns.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the midst of
        this circus of rock welled up a river of transparent bottle-green
        water, that filled a reservoir, in which circled white swans.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On account of the
        incessant agitation of the water, that rose in bells, and broke in
        rhythmic waves against the containing breastwork, neither were the
        swans mirrored in the surface, nor did the white temple of Nemausus
        reflect its peristyle of channeled pillars in the green flood.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This temple
        occupied one side of the basin; on the other, a little removed, were
        the baths, named after Augustus, to which some of the water was
        conducted, after it had passed beyond the precinct within which it
        was regarded as sacred.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page3">[pg
        3]</span><a name="Pg003" id="Pg003" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It would be hard
        to find a more beautiful scene, or see such a gay gathering as that
        assembled near the Holy Fountain on this first day of March.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Hardly less white
        than the swans that dreamily swam in spirals, was the balustrade of
        limestone that surrounded the sheet of heaving water. At intervals on
        this breasting stood pedestals, each supporting a statue in Carrara
        marble. Here was Diana in buskins, holding a bow in her hand, in the
        attitude of running, her right hand turned to draw an arrow from the
        quiver at her back. There was the Gallic god Camulus, in harness,
        holding up a six-rayed wheel, all gilt, to signify the sun. There was
        a nymph pouring water from her urn; again appeared Diana
        contemplating her favorite flower, the white poppy.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But in the place
        of honor, in the midst of the public walk before the fountain,
        surrounded by acacias and pink-blossomed Judas trees, stood the god
        Nemausus, who was at once the presiding deity over the fountain, and
        the reputed founder of the city. He was represented as a youth, of
        graceful form, almost feminine, and though he bore some military
        insignia, yet seemed too girl-like and timid to appear in
        war.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page4">[pg 4]</span><a name=
        "Pg004" id="Pg004" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The fountain had,
        in very truth, created the city. This marvelous upheaval of a limpid
        river out of the heart of the earth had early attracted settlers to
        it, who had built their rude cabins beside the stream and who paid to
        the fountain divine honors. Around it they set up a circle of rude
        stones, and called the place <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Nemet</span></span>—that is to say, the Sacred
        Place. After a while came Greek settlers, and they introduced a new
        civilization and new ideas. They at once erected an image of the
        deity of the fountain, and called this deity Nemausios. The spring
        had been female to the Gaulish occupants of the settlement; it now
        became male, but in its aspect the deity still bore indications of
        feminine origin. Lastly the place became a Roman town. Now beautiful
        statuary had taken the place of the monoliths of unhewn stone that
        had at one time bounded the sacred spring.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On this first day
        of March the inhabitants of Nemausus were congregated near the
        fountain, all in holiday costume.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among them ran and
        laughed numerous young girls, all with wreaths of white hyacinths or
        of narcissus on their heads, and their clear musical voices rang as
        bells in the fresh air.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Yet, jocund as the
        scene was, to such as looked <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page5">[pg
        5]</span><a name="Pg005" id="Pg005" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>closer
        there was observable an under-current of alarm that found expression
        in the faces of the elder men and women of the throng, at least in
        those of such persons as had their daughters flower-crowned.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Many a parent held
        the child with convulsive clasp, and the eyes of fathers and mothers
        alike followed their darlings with a greed, as though desirous of not
        losing one glimpse, not missing one word, of the little creature on
        whom so many kisses were bestowed, and in whom so much love was
        centered.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For this day was
        specially dedicated to the founder and patron of the town, who
        supplied it with water from his unfailing urn, and once in every
        seven years on this day a human victim was offered in sacrifice to
        the god Nemausus, to ensure the continuance of his favor, by a
        constant efflux of water, pure, cool and salubrious.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The victim was
        chosen from among the daughters of the old Gaulish families of the
        town, and the victim was selected from among girls between the ages
        of seven and seventeen. Seven times seven were bound to appear on
        this day before the sacred spring, clothed in white and crowned with
        spring flowers. None knew which would be chosen and which rejected.
        The selection was not made by either the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page6">[pg 6]</span><a name="Pg006" id="Pg006" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>priests or the priestesses attached to the
        temple. Nor was it made by the magistrates of Nemausus. No parent
        might redeem his child. Chance or destiny alone determined who was to
        be chosen out of the forty-nine who appeared before the god.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Suddenly from the
        temple sounded a blast of horns, and immediately the peristyle
        (colonnade) filled with priests and priestesses in white, the former
        with wreaths of silvered olive leaves around their heads, the latter
        crowned with oak leaves of gold foil.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The trumpeters
        descended the steps. The crowd fell back, and a procession advanced.
        First came players on the double flute, or syrinx, with red bands
        round their hair. Then followed dancing girls performing graceful
        movements about the silver image of the god that was borne on the
        shoulders of four maidens covered with spangled veils of the finest
        oriental texture. On both sides paced priests with brazen
        trumpets.</p>

        caught in the arms of her mother, who held her to her heart, and
        sobbed <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page10">[pg 10]</span><a name=

        paused a moment, looking about her, and then, as the troop of
        children revolved, she rattled the rhyme, and threw the pippin at a
        damsel named Tertiola. Whereupon she in turn cast her garland, that
        was of white violets, into the fountain, and withdrew.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again the wreath
        of children circled and Tertiola repeated the jingle till she came to

        Ælia was selected, and came into the middle. This was a child of

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So encouraged, the

        failed, and she had to be reminded of the rest. At last she also was

        wearing the white cloak of widowhood, would have fallen, had she not

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The poor mother
        clasped her arms, and buried her head in them.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then the girl
        thrust aside such as interposed and essayed to reach her mother. The
        priestesses laid hands on her, to stay her, but she said:</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        gladly to death. Otherwise I may weep, and thereby mar thy
        sacrifice.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then, with
        firmness, she thrust through the belt of priestesses, and clasped the
        almost fainting and despairing mother to her heart.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And such was she.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then said the
        brown-habited man whom the lady had called Baudillas:</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Quincta, remember that she is taken from an evil world,
        in which are snares, and that God may have chosen to deliver her by
        this means from some great peril to her soul, against which thou
        wouldst have been powerless to protect her.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <span class="tei tei-q">“I have lived only for her. She is my
        all.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then Perpetua
        gently unclasped the arms of her mother, who was lapsing into
        unconsciousness, kissed her, and said:</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The God of all strength and comfort be to thee a strong
        tower of defence.”</span> And hastily returned to the basin.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The young man who
        before had noticed Perpetua, turned with quivering lip to his
        companion, and said:</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page17">[pg

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        price. Look at her face, Callipodius. Is it the sun that lightens it?
        By Hercules, I could swear that it streamed with effulgence from
        within—as though she were one of the gods.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Pshaw!”</span> scoffed the young man; his hand clutched
        the marble balustrade convulsively, and the blood suffused his brow
        and cheeks and throat. <span class="tei tei-q">“I believe naught
        concerning these deities. My father was a shrewd man, and he ever
        said that the ignorant people created their own gods out of heroes,

        beasts.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“She refuses to be bound.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Shrieks now rang
        from the frantic mother, and she made desperate efforts to reach her
        daughter. She was deaf to the consolations of Baudillas, and to the
        remonstrances and entreaties of the people around her, who pitied and
        yet could not help her. Then said the ædile to his police,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Remove the woman!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The chief priest
        made a sign, and at once the trumpeters began to bray through their
        brazen tubes, making such a noise as to drown the cries of the
        mother.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I would to the gods I could save her,”</span> said

        clenched his hands, and his eyes flashed. Then, without well knowing
        what he did, he unloosed his toga, at the same time that the
        priestesses divested Perpetua of her girded stole, and revealed her
        graceful young form in the tunic bordered with purple indicative of
        the nobility of the house to which she belonged.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The priest had
        bound her hands; but Perpetua smiled, and shook off the bonds at her
        feet. <span class="tei tei-q">“Let be,”</span> she said, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I shall not resist.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On her head she
        still wore a crown of white narcissus. Not more fresh and pure were
        these flowers than her delicate face, which the blood had left. Ever
        and anon she turned her eyes in the direction of her mother, but she
        could no longer see her, as the attendants formed a ring so compact
        that none could break through.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Elect of the god, bride of Nemausus!”</span> said the

        the holy perennial fountain.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Without shrinking,
        the girl obeyed.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She fixed her eyes
        steadily on the sky, and then made the sacred sign on her brow.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“What doest thou?”</span> asked the priestess.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Some witchcraft I
        trow.”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page20">[pg

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <span class="tei tei-q">“I do but invoke the Father of Lights with

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then at a sign,
        the trumpeters blew a furious bellow and as suddenly ceased.
        Whereupon to the strains of flutes and the tinkling of triangles, the
        choir broke forth into the last verse of the hymn:</p>

        <div class="tei tei-lg" style=

          <div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left">

          </div>
        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As they chanted,
        and a cloud of incense mounted around her, Perpetua looked down into
        the water. It was green as glacier ice, and so full of bubbles in
        places as to be there semi-opaque. The depth seemed infinite. No
        bottom was visible. No fish darted through it. An immense volume
        boiled up unceasingly from unknown, unfathomed depths. The wavelets
        lapped the marble breasting as though licking it with greed expecting
        their victim.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The water, after
        brimming the basin, flowed away over a sluice under a bridge as a
        considerable stream. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page21">[pg
        21]</span><a name="Pg021" id="Pg021" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Then
        it lost its sanctity and was employed for profane uses.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Perpetua heard the
        song of the ministers of the god, but gave no heed to it, for her
        lips moved in prayer, and her soul was already unfurling its pure
        wings to soar into that Presence before which, as she surely
        expected, she was about to appear.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the chorus
        had reached the line:</p>

        <div class="tei tei-lg" style=

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">then she was
        thrust by three priestesses from the balustrade and precipitated into
        the basin. She uttered no cry, but from all present a gasp of breath
        was audible.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For a moment she
        disappeared in the vitreous waters, and her white garland alone
        remained floating on the surface.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then her dress
        glimmered, next her arm, as the surging spring threw her up.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Suddenly from the
        entire concourse rose a cry of astonishment and dismay.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The young man,
        Æmilius Lentulus Varo, had leaped into the holy basin.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the ice-green
        water could be seen the young man with nervous arms striking out. He
        held up the girl with one arm. The swell of the rising volumes of
        water greatly facilitated his efforts. Indeed the upsurging flood had
        such force, that to die by drowning in it was a death by inches, for
        as often as a body went beneath the surface, it was again propelled
        upwards.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In a minute he was
        at the breastwork, had one hand on it, then called: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Help, some one, to lift her out!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thereupon the man
        clothed in brown wool put <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page24">[pg
        24]</span><a name="Pg024" id="Pg024" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>down
        his arms, clasped the half-conscious girl and raised her from the
        water. Callipodius assisted, and between them she was lifted out of
        the basin. The priests and priestesses remonstrated with loud cries.
        But some of the spectators cheered. A considerable portion of the men
        ranged themselves beside the two who had the girl in their arms, and
        prevented the ministers of Nemausus from recovering Perpetua from the
        hands of her rescuers.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The men of the
        upper town—Greek colonists, or their descendants—looked
        superciliously and incredulously on the cult of the Gallic deity of
        the fountain. It was tolerated, but laughed at, as something that
        belonged to a class of citizens that was below them in standing.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In another moment
        Æmilius Lentulus had thrown himself upon the balustrade, and stood
        facing the crowd, dripping from every limb, but with a laughing
        countenance.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Seeing that the
        mob was swayed by differing currents of feeling and opinion, knowing
        the people with whom he had to do, he stooped, whispered something
        into the ear of Callipodius; then, folding his arms, he looked
        smilingly around at the tossing crowd, and no sooner did he see his
        opportunity <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page25">[pg
        25]</span><a name="Pg025" id="Pg025" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>than,
        unclasping his arms, he assumed the attitude of an orator, and
        cried:</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Men and brethren of the good city of Nemausus! I marvel
        at ye, that ye dare to set at naught the laws of imperial and eternal
        Rome. Are ye not aware that the god Claudius issued an edict with
        special application to Gaul, that forever forbade human sacrifices?
        Has that edict been withdrawn? I have myself seen and read it graven
        in brass on the steps of the Capitoline Hill at Rome. So long as that
        law stands unrepealed ye are transgressors.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The edict has fallen into desuetude, and desuetude
        abrogates a law!”</span> called one man.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Is it so? How many have suffered under Nero, under
        Caius, because they transgressed laws long forgotten? Let some one
        inform against the priesthood of Nemausus and carry the case to
        Rome.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A stillness fell
        on the assembly. The priests looked at one another.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“But see!”</span> continued Æmilius, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I call you to witness this day. The god himself rejects
        such illegal offerings. Did you not perceive how he spurned the
        virgin from him when ye did impiously cast her into his holy urn?
        Does he not sustain <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page26">[pg
        26]</span><a name="Pg026" id="Pg026" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>life
        with his waters, and not destroy it? Had he desired the sacrifice
        then would he have gulped it down, and you would have seen the maiden
        no more. Not so! He rejected her; with his watery arms he repelled
        her. Every crystal wave he cast up was a rejection. I saw it, and I
        leaped in to deliver the god from the mortal flesh that he refused. I
        appeal to you all again. To whom did the silver image cast the apple?
        Was it to the maiden destined to die? Nay, verily, it was to her who
        was to live. The golden pippin was a fruit of life, whereby he
        designated such as he willed to live. Therefore, I say that the god
        loveth life and not death. Friends and citizens of Nemausus, ye have
        transgressed the law, and ye have violated the will of the divine
        Archegos who founded our city and by whose largess of water we
        live.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then one in the
        crowd shouted: <span class="tei tei-q">“There is a virgin cast yearly
        from the bridge over the Rhodanus at Avenio.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Aye! and much doth that advantage the bridge and the
        city. Did not the floods last November carry away an arch and
        inundate an entire quarter of the town? Was the divine river
        forgetful that he had received his obligation, or was he ungrateful
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page27">[pg 27]</span><a name="Pg027"
        id="Pg027" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>for the favor? Naught that is
        godlike can be either.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“He demanded another life.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Nay! He was indignant that the fools of Avenio should
        continue to treat him as though he were a wild beast that had to be
        glutted, and not as a god. All you parents that fear for your
        children! Some of you have already lost your daughters, and have
        trembled for them; combine, and with one voice proclaim that you will
        no more suffer this. Look to the urn of the divine Nemausus. See how
        evenly the ripples run. Dip your fingers in the water and feel how
        passionless it is. Has he blown forth a blast of seething water and
        steam like the hot springs of Aquæ Sextiæ? Has his fountain clouded
        with anger? Was the god powerless to avenge the act when I plunged
        in? If he had desired the death of the maiden would he have suffered
        me, a mortal, to pluck her from his gelid lips? Make room on Olympus,
        O ye gods, and prepare a throne for Common Sense, and let her have
        domain over the minds of men.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“There is no such god,”</span> called one in the
        crowd.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Ye know her not, so besotted are
        ye.”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page28">[pg

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        ones.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“It is ye who mock them when ye make of them as great
        clowns as yourselves. The true eternal gods laugh to hear me speak
        the truth. Look at the sun. Look at the water, with its many
        twinkling smiles. The gods approve.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whilst the young
        man thus harangued and amused the populace, Baudillas and Quincta,
        assisted by two female slaves of the latter, removed the drenched,
        dripping, and half-drowned girl. They bore her with the utmost
        dispatch out of the crowd down a sidewalk of the city gardens to a
        bench, on which they laid her, till she had sufficiently recovered to
        open her eyes and recognize those who surrounded her.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then said the
        widow to one of the servants: <span class="tei tei-q">“Run,
        Petronella, and bid the steward send porters with a litter. We must
        convey Perpetua as speedily as possible from hence, lest there be a
        riot, and the ministers of the devil stir up the people to insist
        upon again casting her into the water.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“By your leave, lady,”</span> said Baudillas,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“I would advise that, at first, she should
        not be conveyed to your house, but to mine. It is probable, should
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page29">[pg 29]</span><a name="Pg029"
        id="Pg029" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>that happen which you fear,
        that the populace may make a rush to your dwelling, in their attempt
        to get hold of the lady, your daughter. It were well that she
        remained for a while concealed in my house. Send for the porters to
        bring the litter later, when falls the night.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“You are right,”</span> said Quincta. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“It shall be so.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“As in the Acts of the Blessed Apostles it is related
        that the craftsmen who lived by making silver shrines for Diana
        stirred up the people of Ephesus, so may it be now. There are many
        who get their living by the old religion, many whose position and
        influence depend on its maintenance, and such will not lightly allow
        a slight to be cast on their superstitions like as has been offered
        this day. But by evenfall we shall know the humor of the people.
        Young lady, lean on my arm and let me conduct thee to my lodging.
        Thou canst there abide till it is safe for thee to
        depart.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then the
        brown-habited man took the maiden’s arm.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Baudillas was a
        deacon of the Church in Nemausus—a man somewhat advanced in life. His
        humility, and, perhaps, also his lack of scholarship, prevented his
        aspiring to a higher office; moreover, he <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page30">[pg 30]</span><a name="Pg030" id="Pg030" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>was an admirable minister of the Church as
        deacon, at a period when the office was mainly one of keeping the
        registers of the sick and poor, and of distributing alms among such
        as were in need.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The deacon was the
        treasurer of the Church, and he was a man selected for his business
        habits and practical turn of mind. By his office he was more
        concerned with the material than the spiritual distresses of men.
        Nevertheless, he was of the utmost value to the bishops and
        presbyters, for he was their feeler, groping among the poorest,
        entering into the worst haunts of misery and vice, quick to detect
        tokens of desire for better things, and ready to make use of every
        opening for giving rudimentary instruction.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Those who occupied
        the higher grades in the Church, even at this early period, were, for
        the most part, selected from the cultured and noble classes; not that
        the Church had respect of persons, but because of the need there was
        of possessing men who could penetrate into the best houses, and who,
        being related to the governing classes, might influence the upper
        strata of society, as well as that which was below. The great houses
        with their families of slaves in the city, and of servile laborers on
        their <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page31">[pg 31]</span><a name=
        "Pg031" id="Pg031" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>estates, possessed vast
        influence for good or evil. A believing master could flood a whole
        population that depended on him with light, and was certain to treat
        his slaves with Christian humanity. On the other hand, it
        occasionally happened that it was through a poor slave that the truth
        reached the heart of a master or mistress.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Baudillas led the
        girl, now shivering with cold, from the garden, and speedily reached
        a narrow street. Here the houses on each side were lofty, unadorned,
        and had windows only in the upper stories, arched with brick and
        unglazed. In cold weather they were closed with shutters.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The pavement of
        the street was of cobble-stones and rough. No one was visible; no
        sound issued from the houses, save only from one whence came the
        rattle of a loom; and a dog chained at a door barked furiously as the
        little party went by.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“This is the house,”</span> said Baudillas, and he struck
        against a door.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After some waiting
        a bar was withdrawn within, and the door, that consisted of two
        valves, was opened by an old, slightly lame slave.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The singular
        transformation that had taken place in the presiding deity of the
        fountain, from being a nymph into a male god, had not been
        sufficiently complete to alter the worship of the deity. As in the
        days of Druidism, the sacred source was under the charge of
        priestesses, and although, with the change of sex of the deity,
        priests had been appointed to the temple, yet they were few, and
        occupied a position of subordination to the chief priestess. She was
        a woman of sagacity and knowledge of human nature. She perceived
        immediately how critical was the situation. If Æmilius Lentulus were
        allowed to proceed with his speech he would draw to him the excitable
        Southern minds, and it was quite possible might provoke a tumult in
        which the temple would be wrecked. At the least, his words would
        serve to chill popular devotion.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The period when
        Christianity began to radiate through the Roman world was one when
        the tradi<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page34">[pg 34]</span><a name=
        "Pg034" id="Pg034" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>tional paganism with
        its associated rights, that had contented a simpler age, had lost its
        hold on the thoughtful and cultured. Those who were esteemed the
        leaders of society mocked at religion, and although they conformed to
        its ceremonial, did so with ill-disguised contempt. At their tables,
        before their slaves, they laughed at the sacred myths related of the
        gods, as absurd and indecent, and the slaves thought it became them
        to affect the same incredulity as their masters. Sober thinkers
        endeavored to save some form of religion by explaining away the
        monstrous legends, and attributing them to the wayward imagination of
        poets. The existence of the gods they admitted, but argued that the
        gods were the unintelligent and blind forces of nature; or that, if
        rational, they stood apart in cold exclusiveness and cared naught for
        mankind. Many threw themselves into a position of agnosticism. They
        professed to believe in nothing but what their senses assured them
        did exist, and asserted that as there was no evidence to warrant them
        in declaring that there were gods, they could not believe in them;
        that moreover, as there was no revelation of a moral law, there
        existed no distinction between right and wrong. Therefore, the only
        workable maxim on <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page35">[pg
        35]</span><a name="Pg035" id="Pg035" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>which
        to rule life was: <span class="tei tei-q">“Let us eat and drink, for
        to-morrow we may die.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Over all men hung
        the threatening cloud of death. All must undergo the waning of the
        vital powers, the failure of health, the withering of beauty, the
        loss of appetite for the pleasure of life, or if not the loss of
        appetite, at least the faculty for enjoyment.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There was no
        shaking off the oppressive burden, no escape from the gathering
        shadow. Yet, just as those on the edge of a precipice throw
        themselves over, through giddiness, so did men rush on
        self-destruction in startling numbers and with levity, because weary
        of life, and these were precisely such as had enjoyed wealth to the
        full and had run through the whole gamut of pleasures.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">What happened
        after death? Was there any continuance of existence?</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Men craved to
        know. They felt that life was too brief altogether for the
        satisfaction of the aspirations of their souls. They ran from one
        pleasure to another without filling the void within.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Consequently,
        having lost faith in the traditional religion—it was not a
        creed—itself a composite out of some Latin, some Etruscan, and some
        Greek myth and cult, they looked elsewhere for what they
        re<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page36">[pg 36]</span><a name="Pg036"
        id="Pg036" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>quired. Consciences, agonized
        by remorse, sought expiation in secret mysteries, only to find that
        they afforded no relief at all. Minds craving after faith plunged
        into philosophic speculations that led to nothing but unsolved
        eternal query. Souls hungering, thirsting after God the Ideal of all
        that is Holy and pure and lovable, adopted the strange religions
        imported from the East and South; some became votaries of the
        Egyptian Isis and Serapis, others of the Persian Mithras—all to find
        that they had pursued bubbles.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the midst of
        this general disturbance of old ideas, in the midst of a widespread
        despair, Christianity flashed forth and offered what was desired by
        the earnest, the thoughtful, the down-trodden and the
        conscience-stricken—a revelation made by the Father of Spirits as to
        what is the destiny of man, what is the law of right and wrong, what
        is in store for those who obey the law; how also pardon might be
        obtained for transgression, and grace to restore fallen humanity.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Christianity
        meeting a wide-felt want spread rapidly, not only among the poor and
        oppressed, but extensively among the cultured and the noble. All
        connected by interest, or prejudiced by association <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page37">[pg 37]</span><a name="Pg037" id="Pg037"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>with the dominant and established
        paganism, were uneasy and alarmed. The traditional religion was
        honeycombed and tottering to its fall, and how it was to be revived
        they knew not. That it would be supplanted by the new faith in Christ
        was what they feared.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The chief
        priestess of Nemausus knew that in the then condition of minds an act
        of overt defiance might lead to a very general apostasy. It was to
        her of sovereign importance to arrest the movement at once, to
        silence Æmilius, to have him punished for his act of sacrilege, and
        to recover possession of Perpetua.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She snatched the
        golden apple from the hand of the image, and, giving it to an
        attendant, said: <span class="tei tei-q">“Run everywhere; touch and
        summon the Cultores Nemausi.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The girl did as
        commanded. She sped among the crowd, and, with the pippin, touched
        one, then another, calling: <span class="tei tei-q">“Worshippers of
        Nemausus, to the aid of the god!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The result was
        manifest at once. It was as though an electrical shock had passed
        through the multitude. Those touched and those who had heard the
        summons at once disengaged themselves from the <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page38">[pg 38]</span><a name="Pg038" id="Pg038"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>crush, drew together, and ceased to
        express their individual opinions. Indeed, such as had previously
        applauded the sentiments of Æmilius, now assumed an attitude of
        disapprobation.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Rapidly men
        rallied about the white-robed priestesses, who surrounded the silver
        image.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To understand what
        was taking place it is necessary that a few words should be given in
        explanation.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Roman
        population of the towns—not in Italy only, but in all the Romanized
        provinces, banded itself in colleges or societies very much like our
        benefit clubs. Those guilds were very generally under the invocation
        of some god or goddess, and those who belonged to them were entitled
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Cultores”</span> or worshippers of such or
        such a deity. These clubs had their secretaries and treasurers, their
        places of meeting, their common chests, their feasts, and their
        several constitutions. Each society made provision for its members in
        time of sickness, and furnished a dignified funeral in the club
        Columbarium, after which all sat down to a funeral banquet in the
        supper room attached to the cemetery. These colleges or guilds
        enjoyed great privileges, and were protected by the law.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At a time when a
        political career was closed <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page39">[pg
        39]</span><a name="Pg039" id="Pg039" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>to
        all but such as belonged to the governing class, the affairs of these
        clubs engrossed the attention of the members and evoked great rivalry
        and controversies. One admirable effect of the clubs was the
        development of a spirit of fellowship among the members, and another
        was that it tended in a measure to break down class exclusiveness.
        Men of rank and wealth, aware of the power exercised by these guilds,
        eagerly accepted the offices of patron to them, though the clubs
        might be those of cord-wainers, armorers or sailmakers. And those who
        were ordinary members of a guild regarded their patrons with
        affection and loyalty. Now that the signal had been sent round to
        rally the Cultores Nemausi, every member forgot his private feeling,
        sank his individual opinion, and fell into rank with his fellows,
        united in one common object—the maintenance by every available man,
        and at every sacrifice, of the respect due to the god.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These Cultores
        Nemausi at once formed into organized bodies under their several
        officers, in face of a confused crowd that drifted hither and thither
        without purpose and without cohesion.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Æmilius found
        himself no longer hearkened to. To him this was a matter of no
        concern. He had <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page40">[pg
        40]</span><a name="Pg040" id="Pg040" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>sought to engage attention only so as to
        withdraw it from Perpetua and leave opportunity for her friends to
        remove her.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now that this
        object was attained, he laughingly leaped from the balustrade and
        made as though he was about to return home.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But at once the
        chief priestess saw his object, and cried: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Seize him! He blasphemes the god, founder of the city.
        He would destroy the college. Let him be conveyed into the temple,
        that the Holy One may there deal with him as he wills.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Prefect of
        Police, whose duty it was to keep order, now advanced with the few
        men he had deemed necessary to bring with him, and he said in
        peremptory tone:</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“We can suffer no violence. If he has transgressed the
        law, let him be impeached.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Sir,”</span> answered the priestess, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“we will use no violence. He has insulted the majesty of
        the god. He has snatched from him his destined and devoted victim.
        Yet we meditate no severe reprisals. All I seek is that he may be
        brought into the presence of the god in the adytum, where is a table
        spread with cakes. Let him there sprinkle incense on the fire and eat
        of the cakes. Then he shall go free. <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page41">[pg 41]</span><a name="Pg041" id="Pg041" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>If the god be wroth, he will manifest his
        indignation. But if, as I doubt not, he be placable, then shall this
        man depart unmolested.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Against this I have naught to advance,”</span> said the
        prefect.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But one standing
        by whispered him: <span class="tei tei-q">“Those cakes are not to be
        trusted. I have heard of one who ate and fell down in convulsions
        after eating.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“That is a matter between the god and Æmilius Varo. I
        have done my duty.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then the
        confraternity of the Cultores Nemausi spread itself so as to encircle
        the place and include Æmilius, barring every passage. He might,
        doubtless, have escaped had he taken to his heels at the first
        summons of the club to congregate, but he had desired to occupy the
        attention of the people as long as possible, and it did not comport
        with his self-respect to run from danger.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Throwing over him
        the toga which he had cast aside when he leaped into the pond, he
        thrust one hand into his bosom and leisurely strode through the
        crowd, waving them aside with the other hand, till he stopped by the
        living barrier of the worshippers of Nemausus.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“You cannot pass, sir,”</span> said the captain of that
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page42">[pg 42]</span><a name="Pg042"
        id="Pg042" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>party which intercepted his
        exit. <span class="tei tei-q">“The chief priestess hath ordered that
        thou appear before the god in his cella and then do worship and
        submit thyself to his will.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And how is that will to be declared?”</span> asked the
        young man, jestingly.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Sir! thou must eat one of the dedicated
        placenta.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I have heard of these same cakes and have no stomach for
        them.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Nevertheless eat thou must.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“What if I will not?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Then constraint will be used. The prefect has given his
        consent. Who is to deliver thee?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Who! Here come my deliverers!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A tramp of feet
        was audible.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Instantly Æmilius
        ran back to the balustrade, leaped upon it, and, waving his arm,
        shouted:</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“To my aid, Utriculares! But use no violence.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Instantly with a
        shout a dense body of men that had rolled into the gardens dashed
        itself against the ring of Cultores Nemausi. They brandished marlin
        spikes and oars to which were attached inflated goat-skins and
        bladders. These they whirled around <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page43">[pg 43]</span><a name="Pg043" id="Pg043" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>their heads and with them they smote to the left
        and to the right. The distended skins clashed against such as stood
        in opposition, and sent them reeling backward; whereat the lusty men
        wielding the wind-bags thrust their way as a wedge through their
        ranks. The worshippers of Nemausus swore, screamed, remonstrated, but
        were unable to withstand the onslaught. They were beaten back and
        dispersed by the whirling bladders.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The general mob
        roared with laughter and cheered the boatmen who formed the attacking
        party. Cries of <span class="tei tei-q">“Well done, Utriculares! That
        is a fine delivery, Wind-bag-men! Ha, ha! A hundred to five on the
        Utriculares! You are come in the nick of time, afore your patron was
        made to nibble the poisoned cakes.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The men armed with
        air-distended skins did harm to none. Their weapons were calculated
        to alarm and not to injure. To be banged in the face with a bladder
        was almost as disconcerting as to be smitten with a cudgel, but it
        left no bruise, it broke no bone, and the man sent staggering by a
        wind-bag was received in the arms of those in rear with jibe or laugh
        and elicited no compassion.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Utriculares
        speedily reached Æmilius, gave <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page44">[pg 44]</span><a name="Pg044" id="Pg044" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>vent to a cheer; they lifted him on their
        shoulders, and, swinging the inflated skins and shouting, marched
        off, out of the gardens, through the Forum, down the main street of
        the lower town unmolested, under the conduct of Callipodius.</p>

        receives also the drain of the western side of the Jura, as well as
        that of the Graian and Cottian Alps. The Durance pours in its
        auxiliary flood below Avignon.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After a rapid thaw
        of snow, or the breaking of charged rain clouds on the mountains,
        these rivers increase in volume, and as the banks of the Rhône below
        the junction of the Durance and St. Raphael are low, it overflows and
        spreads through the flat alluvial delta. It would be more exact to
        say that it was wont to overflow, rather than that it does so
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page47">[pg 47]</span><a name="Pg047"
        id="Pg047" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>now. For at present, owing to
        the embankments thrown up and maintained at enormous cost, the Rhône
        can only occasionally submerge the low-lying land, whereas anciently
        such floods were periodical and as surely expected as those of the
        Nile.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The overflowing
        Rhône formed a vast region of lagoons that extended from Tarascon and
        Beaucaire to the Gulf of Lyons, and spread laterally over the Crau on
        one side to Nîmes on the other. Nîmes itself stood on its own river,
        the Vistre, but this fed marshes and <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“broads”</span> that were connected with the tangle of
        lagoons formed by the Rhône.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Arelate, the great
        emporium of the trade between Gaul and Italy, occupied a rocky islet
        in the midst of water that extended as far as the eye could reach.
        This tract of submerged land was some sixty miles in breadth by forty
        in depth, was sown with islets of more or less elevation and extent.
        Some were bold, rocky eminences, others were mere rubble and
        sand-banks formed by the river. Arelate or Arles was accessible by
        vessels up and down the river or by rafts that plied the lagoons, and
        by the canal constructed by Marius, that traversed them from Fossoe
        Marino. As the canal was not deep, and as the current of the river
        was strong, ships were often unable <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page48">[pg 48]</span><a name="Pg048" id="Pg048" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>to ascend to the city through these arteries,
        and had to discharge their merchandise on the coast upon rafts that
        conveyed it to the great town, and when the floods permitted, carried
        much to Nemausus.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As the sheets of
        water were in places and at periods shallow, the rafts were made
        buoyant, though heavily laden, by means of inflated skins and
        bladders placed beneath them.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As the conveyance
        of merchandise engaged a prodigious number of persons, the raftsmen
        had organized themselves into the guild of Utriculares, or Wind-bag
        men, and as they became not infrequently involved in contests with
        those whose interests they crossed, and on whose privileges they
        infringed, they enlisted the aid of lawyers to act as their patrons,
        to bully their enemies, and to fight their battles against
        assailants. Among the numerous classic monumental inscriptions that
        remain in Provence, there are many in which a man of position is
        proud to have it recorded that he was an honorary member of the club
        of the inflated-skin men.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nemausus owed much
        of its prosperity to the fact that it was the trade center for wool
        and for skins. The Cevennes and the great limestone plateaux that
        abut upon them nourished countless <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page49">[pg 49]</span><a name="Pg049" id="Pg049" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>herds of goats and flocks of sheep, and the
        dress of everyone at the period being of wool the demand for fleeces
        was great; consequently vast quantities of wool were brought from the
        mountains of Nîmes, whence it was floated away on rafts sustained by
        the skins that came from the same quarter.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The archipelago
        that studded the fresh-water sea was inhabited by fishermen, and
        these engaged in the raft-carriage. The district presented a singular
        contrast of high culture and barbarism. In Arles, Nîmes, Narbonne
        there was a Greek element. There was here and there an infusion of
        Phœnician blood. The main body of the people consisted of the dusky
        Ligurians, who had almost entirely lost their language, and had
        adopted that of their Gaulish conquerors, the Volex. These latter
        were distinguished by their fair hair, their clear complexions, their
        stalwart frames. Another element in the composite mass was that of
        the colonists. After the battle of Actium, Augustus had rewarded his
        Egypto-Greek auxiliaries by planting them at Nemausus, and giving
        them half the estates of the Gaulish nobility. To these Greeks were
        added Roman merchants, round-headed, matter-of-fact looking men,
        destitute of imagination, but full of practical
        sense.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page50">[pg 50]</span><a name=
        "Pg050" id="Pg050" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These incongruous
        elements that in the lapse of centuries have been fused, were, at the
        time of this tale, fairly distinct.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“You are in the right, my friends,”</span> said Æmilius.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“The kiln is heated too hot for comfort. It
        would roast me. I will go even to Arelate, if you will be good enough
        to convey me thither.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“With the greatest of pleasure, sir.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Æmilius had an
        office at Arles. He was a lawyer, but his headquarters were at
        Nemausus, to which town he belonged by birth. He represented a good
        family, and was descended from one of the colonists under Agrippa and
        Augustus. His father was dead, and though he was not wealthy, he was
        well off, and possessed a villa and estates on the mountain sides, at
        some distance from the town. In the heats of summer he retired to his
        villa.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On this day of
        March there had been a considerable gathering of raftsmen at
        Nemausus, who had utilized the swollen waters in the lagoons for the
        conveyance of merchandise.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Æmilius stepped
        upon a raft that seemed to be poised on bubbles, so light was it on
        the surface of the water, and the men at once thrust from land with
        their poles.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page51">[pg
        51]</span><a name="Pg051" id="Pg051" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The bottom was
        everywhere visible, owing to the whiteness of the limestone pebbles
        and the sand that composed it, and through the water darted
        innumerable fish. The liquid element was clear. Neither the Vistre
        nor the stream from the fountain brought down any mud, and the turbid
        Rhône had deposited all its sediment before its waters reached and
        mingled with those that flowed from the Cebennæ. There was no
        perceptible current. The weeds under water were still, and the only
        thing in motion were the darting fish.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The raftmen were
        small, nimble fellows, with dark hair, dark eyes and pleasant faces.
        They laughed and chatted with each other over the incident of the
        rescue of their patron, but it was in their own dialect,
        unintelligible to Æmilius, to whom they spoke in broken Latin, in
        which were mingled Greek words.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now and then they
        burst simultaneously into a wailing chant, and then interrupted their
        song to laugh and gesticulate and mimic those who had been knocked
        over by their wind-bags.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As Æmilius did not
        understand their conversation and their antics did not amuse him, he
        lay on the raft upon a wolfskin that had been spread over
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page52">[pg 52]</span><a name="Pg052"
        id="Pg052" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the timber, looking dreamily
        into the water and at the white golden flowers of the floating weeds
        through which the raft was impelled. The ripples caused by the
        displacement of the water caught and flashed the sun in his eyes like
        lightning.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">His mind reverted
        to what had taken place, but unlike the raftmen he did not consider
        it from its humorous side. He wondered at himself for the active part
        he had taken. He wondered at himself for having acted without
        premeditation. Why had he interfered to save the life of a girl whom
        he had not known even by name? Why had he been so indiscreet as to
        involve himself in a quarrel with his fellow-citizens in a matter in
        no way concerning him? What had impelled him so rashly to bring down
        on himself the resentment of an influential and powerful body?</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The youth of Rome
        and of the Romanized provinces was at the time of the empire very
        blasé. It enjoyed life early, and wearied rapidly of pleasure. It
        became skeptical as to virtue, and looked on the world of men with
        cynical contempt. It was selfish, sensual, cruel. But in Æmilius
        there was something nobler than what existed in most; the perception
        of what was good and true was not dead in him; <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page53">[pg 53]</span><a name="Pg053" id="Pg053"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>it had slept. And now the face of Perpetua
        looked up at him out of the water. Was it her beauty that had so
        attracted him as to make him for a moment mad and cast his cynicism
        aside, as the butterfly throws away the chrysalis from which it
        breaks? No, beautiful indeed she was, but there was in her face
        something inexpressible, undefinable, even mentally; something
        conceivable in a goddess, an aura from another world, an emanation
        from Olympus. It was nothing that was subject to the rule. It was not
        due to proportion; it could be seized by neither painter nor
        sculptor. What was it? That puzzled him. He had been fascinated,
        lifted out of his base and selfish self to risk his life to do a
        generous, a noble act. He was incapable of explaining to himself what
        had wrought this sudden change in him.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He thought over
        all that had taken place. How marvelous had been the serenity with
        which Perpetua had faced death! How ready she was to cast away life
        when life was in its prime and the world with all its pleasures was
        opening before her! He could not understand this. He had seen men die
        in the arena, but never thus. What had given the girl that look, as
        though a light within shone through her features? What was there in
        her that made him <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page54">[pg
        54]</span><a name="Pg054" id="Pg054" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>feel
        that to think of her, save with reverence, was to commit a
        sacrilege?</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the heart of
        Æmilius there was, though he knew it not, something of that same
        spirit which pervaded the best of men and the deepest thinkers in
        that decaying, corrupt old world. All had acquired a disbelief in
        virtue because they nowhere encountered it, and yet all were animated
        with a passionate longing for it as the ideal, perhaps the
        unattainable, but that which alone could make life really happy.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was this which
        disturbed the dainty epicureanism of Horace, which gave verjuice to
        the cynicism of Juvenal, which roused the savage bitterness of
        Perseus. More markedly still, the craving after this better life, on
        what based, he could not conjecture, filled the pastoral mind of
        Virgil, and almost with a prophet’s fire, certainly with an aching
        desire, he sang of the coming time when the vestiges of ancient fraud
        would be swept away and the light of a better day, a day of truth and
        goodness would break on the tear- and blood-stained world.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And now this dim
        groping after what was better than he had seen; this inarticulate
        yearning after something higher than the sordid round of pleasure;
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page55">[pg 55]</span><a name="Pg055"
        id="Pg055" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>this innate assurance that to
        man there is an ideal of spiritual loveliness and perfection to which
        he can attain if shown the way—all this now had found expression in
        the almost involuntary plunge into the <a name="corr055" id="corr055"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class=
        "tei tei-corr">Nemausean</span> pool. He had seen the ideal, and he
        had broken with the regnant paganism to reach and rescue it.</p>

        started, and an expression of annoyance swept over his face. The

        to secure her.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“You shall not go back to Nemausus. You would but
        jeopardize your own valuable life without the possibility of
        assisting her; nay, rather wouldst thou direct attention to her.
        Leave the matter with me and trust my devotion to thine
        interests.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I must learn tidings of her. I shall not rest till
        assured that she is out of danger. By the infernal gods, Callipodius,
        I know not what is come upon me, but I feel that if ill befall her, I
        could throw myself on a sword and welcome death, life having lost to
        me all value.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Then I tell thee this, most resolute of men,”</span>
        said Callipodius, <span class="tei tei-q">“I will return to the town.
        My nothingness will pass unquestioned. Thou shalt tarry at the house
        of Flavillus yonder on the promontory. He is a timber merchant, and
        the place is clean. The woman bears a good name, and, what is better,
        can cook well. The house is poor and undeserving of the honor of
        receiving so distinguished a person as thyself; but if thou wilt
        condescend——”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        speedy, relieve my anxiety and be true as thou dost value my

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then Æmilius
        signed to the raftmen to put him ashore at the landing place to the
        timber yard of Flavillus.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Having landed he
        mounted a slight ascent to a cottage that was surrounded by piles of
        wood—of oak, chestnut, pine and olive. Flavillus was a merchant on a
        small scale, but a man of energy and industry. He dealt with the
        natives of the Cebennæ, and bought the timber they felled, conveyed
        it to his stores, whence it was distributed to the towns in the
        neighborhood; and supplies were furnished to the shipbuilders at
        Arelate.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The merchant was
        now away, but his wife received Æmilius with deference. She had heard
        his name from the raftmen, and was acquainted with Callipodius, a
        word from whom sufficed as an introduction.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She apologized
        because her house was small, as also because her mother, then with
        her, was at the point of death from old age, not from any fever or
        other disorder. If Æmilius Lentulus, under the circumstances, would
        pardon imperfection in attendance, she would gladly extend to him
        such hospitality as she could offer. Æmilius would have gone
        elsewhere, but that the only other house he could think of that was
        near was a tavern, then crowded by Utri<span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page61">[pg 61]</span><a name="Pg061" id="Pg061" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>culares, who occupied every corner. He was sorry
        to inconvenience the woman, yet accepted her offer. The period was
        not one in which much consideration was shown to those in a lower
        grade. The citizens and nobles held that their inferiors existed for
        their convenience only. Æmilius shared in the ideas of his time and
        class, but he had sufficient natural delicacy to make him reluctant
        to intrude where his presence was necessarily irksome. Nevertheless,
        as there was no other place to which he could go, he put aside this
        feeling of hesitation.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The house was
        small, and was constructed of wood upon a stone basement. The
        partitions between the rooms were of split planks, and the joints
        were in places open, and knots had come out, so that what passed in
        one apartment was audible, and, to some extent, visible in another. A
        bedroom in a Roman house was a mere closet, furnished with a bed
        only. All washing was done at the baths, not in the house. The room
        had no window, only a door over which hung a curtain.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Æmilius divested
        himself of his wet garment and gave it to his hostess to dry, then
        wrapped himself in his toga and awaited supper.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The meal was
        prepared as speedily as might be. <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        apples of last year. Wine was abundant, and so was oil.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When he had eaten
        and was refreshed, moved by a kindly thought Æmilius asked if he
        might see the sick mother. His hostess at once conducted him to her
        apartment, and he stood by the old woman’s bed. The evening sun shone
        in at the door, where stood the daughter holding back the curtain,
        and lighted the face of the aged woman. It was thin, white and drawn.
        The eyes were large and lustrous.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I am an intruder,”</span> said the young man,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“yet I would not sleep the night in this
        house without paying my respects to the mother of my kind hostess.
        Alas! thou art one I learn who is unable to escape that which befalls
        all mortals. It is a lot evaded only by the gods, if there be any
        truth in the tales told concerning them. It must be a satisfaction to
        you to contemplate the many pleasures enjoyed in a long life, just as
        after an excellent meal we can in mind revert to it and retaste in
        imagination every course—as indeed I do with the supper so daintily
        furnished by my hostess.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        console the mind and gratify the ambition. With your excellent
        daughter and the timber-yard hard by, you may calculate on a really
        handsome funeral pyre—plenty of olive wood and fragrant pine logs
        from the Cebennæ. I myself will be glad to contribute a handful of
        oriental spices to throw into the flames.”</span></p>

        see the pomp and hear the good things said of him.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Æmilius shook his
        head. If this was not the raving of a disordered mind, what could it
        be?</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He retired to his
        apartment.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He was tired. He
        had nothing to occupy him, so he cast himself on his bed.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Shortly he heard
        the voice of a man. He started and listened in the hopes that
        Callipodius had returned, but as the tones were strange to him he lay
        down again.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Presently a light
        struck through a knot in the boards that divided his room from that
        of the dying woman. Then he heard the strange voice say: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Peace be to this house and to all that dwell
        therein.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At first the
        newcomer did inquire concerning the health of the patient, but then
        rapidly passed to other matters, and these strange to the ear of the
        young lawyer. He had gathered that the old woman was a Christian; but
        of Christians he knew no more than that they were reported to worship
        the head of an ass, to devour little children, and to indulge in
        debauchery at their evening banquets.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The strange man
        spoke to the dying woman—not of funeral and cenotaph as things to
        look forward to, but to life and immortality, to joy and rest from
        labor.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        Christ, the Sun of Righteousness. Though thou steppest down into the
        river, yet His cross shall be thy stay and His staff shall comfort
        thee. He goeth before to be thy guide. He standeth to be thy defence.
        The spirits of evil cannot hurt thee. The Good Shepherd will gather
        thee into His fold. The True Physician will heal all thine
        infirmities. As the second Joshua, He will lead thee out of the
        wilderness into the land of Promise. The angels of God surround thee.
        The light of the heavenly city streams over thee. Rejoice, rejoice!
        The night is done and the day is at hand. For all thy labors thou
        shalt be recompensed double. For all thy sorrows He will comfort

        through a chink, saw the stranger lay his hand on the woman’s brow.
        He saw how the next moment he withdrew it, and how, turning to her

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The house into
        which the widow lady and her daughter entered was that used by the
        Christians of Nemausus as their church. A passage led into the
        <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">atrium</span></span>, a quadrangular court in
        the midst of the house into which most of the rooms opened, and in
        the center of which was a small basin of water. On the marble
        breasting of this tank stood, in a heathen household, the altar to
        the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
        "la"><span style="font-style: italic">lares et penates</span></span>,
        the tutelary gods of the dwelling. This court was open above for the
        admission of light and air, and to allow the smoke to escape.
        Originally this had been the central chamber of the Roman house, but
        eventually it became a court. It was the focus of family life, and
        the altar in it represented the primitive family hearth in times
        before civilization had developed the house out of the cabin.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whoever entered a
        pagan household was expected, as token of respect, to strew a few
        grains of incense on the ever-burning hearth, or to dip his fingers
        in the water basin and flip a few drops over <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page69">[pg 69]</span><a name="Pg069" id="Pg069" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>the images. But in a Christian household no such
        altar and images of gods were to be found. A Christian gave great
        offense by refusing to comply with the generally received customs,
        and his disregard on this point of etiquette was held to be as
        indicative of boorishness and lack of graceful courtesy, as would be
        the conduct nowadays of a man who walked into a drawing-room wearing
        his hat.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Immediately
        opposite the entrance into the <span lang="la" class=
        "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">atrium</span></span>, on the further side of the
        tank, and beyond the altar to the <span lang="la" class=
        "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">lares et penates</span></span>, elevated above
        the floor of the court by two or three white-marble steps, was a
        semicircular chamber, with elaborate mosaic floor, and the walls
        richly painted. This was the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign"
        xml:lang="la"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">tablinum</span></span>. The paintings
        represented scenes from heathen mythology in such houses as belonged
        to pagans, but in the dwelling of Baudillas, the deacon, the pictures
        that had originally decorated it had been plastered over, and upon
        this coating green vines had been somewhat rudely drawn, with birds
        of various descriptions playing among the foliage and pecking at the
        grapes.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Around the wall
        were seats; and here, in a pagan house, the master received his
        guests. His seat was at the extremity of the apse, and was of white
        mar<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page70">[pg 70]</span><a name="Pg070"
        id="Pg070" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>ble. When such a house was
        employed for Christian worship, the clergy occupied the seat against
        the wall and the bishop that of the master in the center. In the
        chord of the apse above the steps stood the altar, now no longer
        smoking nor dedicated to the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign"
        xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Lar

        But this altar was in itself different wholly from that which had
        stood by the water tank. Instead of being a block of marble, with a
        hearth on top, it consisted of a table on three, sometimes four,
        bronze legs, the slab sometimes of stone, more generally of
        wood.<a id="noteref_1" name="noteref_1" href="#note_1"><span class=

        hall or court, except when used for the reception of guests, by rich
        curtains running on rings upon a rod. These curtains were drawn back
        or forward during the celebration of the liturgy, and this has
        continued to form a portion of the furniture of an Oriental church,
        whether Greek, Armenian, or Syrian.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In like manner the
        <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the right side
        of the court was the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign"
        xml:lang="la"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">triclinium</span></span> or dining-room, and
        this was employed by the early Christians for their love-feasts.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Owing to the
        protection extended by law to the colleges or clubs, the Christians
        sought to screen themselves from persecution by representing
        themselves as forming one of these clubs, and affecting their usages.
        Even on their tombstones they so designated themselves, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Cultores Dei,”</span> and they were able to carry on
        their worship under the appearance of frequenting guild meetings. One
        of the notable features of such secular or semi-religious societies
        was the convivial supper for the members, attended by all. The Church
        adopted this supper, called it Agape, but of course gave to it a
        special signification. It was made to be a symbol of that unity among
        Christians which was supposed to exist between all members. The
        supper was also a convenient means whereby the rich could contribute
        to the necessities of the poor, and was regarded as a fulfilment of
        the Lord’s command: <span class="tei tei-q">“When thou makest a
        feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Already, in the
        third century, the believers who belonged to the superior classes had
        withdrawn from <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page72">[pg
        72]</span><a name="Pg072" id="Pg072" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>them,
        and alleged as their excuse the command: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy
        friends, nor thy brethren, neither thy kinsman, nor thy rich
        neighbors.”</span> Their actual reason was, however, distaste for
        associating with such as belonged to the lower orders, and from being
        present at scenes that were not always edifying.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The house of
        Baudillas had once been of consequence, and his family one of
        position; but that had been in the early days of the colony before
        the indigenous Gaulish nobility had been ousted from every place of
        authority, and the means for enriching themselves had been drawn away
        by the greed of the conquerors. The quarter of the town in which was
        his mansion had declined in respectability. Many of the houses of the
        old Volcian gentry had been sold and converted into lodgings for
        artisans. In this case the ancestral dwelling remained in the
        possession of the last representative of the family, but it was out
        of repair, and the owner was poor.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I hardly know what should be done,”</span> said
        Baudillas to himself, rather than to the ladies he was escorting.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“The Church has been enjoined to assemble
        this afternoon for the Agape, and our bishop, <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page73">[pg 73]</span><a name="Pg073" id="Pg073"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Castor, is absent at this critical
        juncture. He has gone on a pastoral round, taking advantage of the
        floods to visit, in boat, some of the outlying hamlets and villages
        where there are believers. It seems to me hardly prudent for us to
        assemble when there is such agitation of spirits. Ladies, allow my
        house-keeper—she was my nurse—to conduct you where you can repose
        after the fatigue and distress you have undergone. She will provide
        dry garments for Perpetua, and hot water for her feet. The baths are
        the proper place, but it would be dangerous for her to adventure
        herself in public.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Baudillas paced
        the court in anxiety of mind. He did not know what course to adopt.
        He was not a man of initiative. He was devoted to his duty and
        discharged whatever he was commanded to do with punctilious nicety;
        but he was thrown into helpless incapacity when undirected by a
        superior mind, or not controlled by a dominant will.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It would be
        difficult to communicate with the brethren. He had but one male
        servant, Pedo, who had a stiff hip-joint. He could not send him round
        to give notice of a postponement, and Baudillas was not the man to
        take such a step without orders. Probably, said he to himself, the
        commotion would <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page74">[pg
        74]</span><a name="Pg074" id="Pg074" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>abate
        before evening. There would be much feasting in the town that
        afternoon. The Cultores Nemausi had their club dinner; and the
        families of Volcian descent made it a point of honor to entertain on
        that day, dedicated to their Gallic founder and hero-god. It was
        precisely for this reason that the Agape had been appointed to be
        celebrated on the first of March. When all the lower town was holding
        debauch, the harmless reunion of the Christians would pass
        unregarded.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“What shall I do?”</span> said the deacon. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Castor, our bishop, should not have absented himself at
        such a time, but then how could he have foreseen what has taken
        place? I will take care that the ladies be provided with whatever
        they may need, and then will sally forth and ascertain what temper
        our fellow-citizens are in. We southerners blaze up like a fire of
        straw, and as soon does our flame expire. If I meet some of the
        brethren, I will consult with them what is to be done. As it is we
        have postponed the Agape till set of sun, when we deemed that all the
        town would be indoors merry-making.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">An hour later, a
        slave of the lady Quincta arrived to say that her house was watched,
        and that the servants did not deem it advisable to leave with the
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page75">[pg 75]</span><a name="Pg075"
        id="Pg075" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>litter, lest some attempt
        should be made to track them to the house where their mistress was
        concealed, in which case the rabble might even try to get possession
        of Perpetua.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Quincta was
        greatly alarmed at the tidings, and bade that the litter should on no
        account be sent. When those watching her door had been withdrawn,
        then a faithful slave was to announce the fact, and she and her
        daughter would steal home afoot. Thus passed the time, with anxiety
        contracting the hearts of all. Quincta was a timid woman, Baudillas,
        as already said, irresolute. In the afternoon, gifts began to arrive
        for the love-feast. Slaves brought hampers of bread, quails,
        field-fare stuffed with truffles; brown pots containing honey were
        also deposited by them in the passage. Others brought branches of
        dried raisins, apples, eggs, flasks of oil, and bouquets of spring
        flowers.<a id="noteref_2" name="noteref_2" href=
        "#note_2"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Baudillas was
        relieved when the stream of oblations began to flow in, as it decided
        for him the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page76">[pg
        76]</span><a name="Pg076" id="Pg076" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>matter of the Agape. It must take place—it could
        not be deferred, as some of the food sent was perishable.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A slave arrived
        laden with an <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
        "la"><span style="font-style: italic">amphora</span></span>—a red
        earthenware bottle, pointed below, so that to maintain it upright it
        had to be planted in sand or ashes. On the side was a seal with the
        sacred symbol, showing that it contained wine set apart for religious
        usage.<a id="noteref_3" name="noteref_3" href="#note_3"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3</span></span></a></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Sir!”</span> said the bearer, <span class=

        (near Lunel).<a id="noteref_4" name="noteref_4" href=

        Provence sun is gathered and stored in it, to break forth and glow in
        the veins, to mount into and fire the brain, and to make and kindle a
        furnace in the heart.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“It shall be used with discretion, Tarsius,”</span> said
        the deacon.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“By Bacchus!—I ask your pardon, deacon! Old habits are
        not easily laid aside. What was I saying? Oh—you remarked something
        about discretion. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page77">[pg
        77]</span><a name="Pg077" id="Pg077" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>For
        my part I consider that my master has exercised none in sending this
        to your love-feast. Bah! it is casting pearls before swine to pour
        out this precious essence into the cups of such a beggarly, vagabond
        set as assemble here. The quality folk are becoming weary of these
        banquets and hold aloof.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“That is sadly true,”</span> observed Baudillas,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“and the effect of this withdrawal is that it
        aggravates the difficulties of myself and my brethren.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The choice liquor is thrown away on such as you have as
        congregation. How can they relish the Ambrussian if they have not had
        their palates educated to know good liquor from bad? On my faith as a
        Christian! were I master instead of slave, I would send you the wine
        of the year when Sosius Falco and Julius Clarus were consuls—then the
        grapes mildewed in the bunch, and the wine is naught but vinegar, no
        color, no bouquet, no substance. Gentlemen and slaves can’t drink it.
        But I reckon that my master thinks to condone his absence by sending
        one of his choicest flasks.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“You are somewhat free of tongue, Tarsius.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I am a frank man though enslaved. Thoughts are free, and
        my tongue is not enchained. I shall attend the banquet this evening.
        The master and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page78">[pg

        members of the family, may be present at the Agape. I will trouble
        you, when pouring out the Ambrussian wine, not to forget that I had
        to sweat under the flask, to your house.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I think, Tarsius, I cannot do better than place the
        bottle under your charge. You know its value, and the force of the
        wine. Distribute as you see fit.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Aye; I know who will appreciate it, and who are unworthy
        of a drop. I accept the responsibility. You do wisely, deacon, in
        trusting me—a knowing one,”</span> and he slapped his breast and
        pursed up his mouth.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then another
        servant appeared with a basket.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Here, sir!”</span> said he to the deacon. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I bring you honey-cakes. The lady Lampridia sends them.
        She is infirm and unable to leave her house, but she would fain do

        and also garments that she has made for children. She desires that
        you will distribute them among such parents as have occasion for
        them.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Next came a man of
        equestrian rank, and drew the deacon aside.</p><span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page79">[pg 79]</span><a name="Pg079" id="Pg079"

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Where is Castor?”</span> he inquired in an agitated
        voice. <span class="tei tei-q">“I cannot appear this evening. The
        whole town is in effervescence. Inquisition may be made for us
        Christians. There will be a tumult. When they persecute you in one
        city—fly to another! That is the divine command, and I shall obey it
        to the letter. I have sent forward servants and mules—and shall
        escape with my wife and children to my villa.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The bishop is away. He will be back this evening. I have
        not known what to do, whether or not to postpone the Agape to another
        day.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“No harm will come of it if you hold the feast. None will
        attend save the poor and such as are on the books of the Church, the
        widows and those to whom a good meal is a boon. The authorities will
        not trouble themselves about the like of them. I don’t relish the
        aspect of affairs, and shall be off before the storm breaks.”</span>
        Then the knight added hastily, <span class="tei tei-q">“Here is
        money, distribute it, and bid the recipients pray for me and mine,
        that no harm befall us.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Baudillas saw that
        the man was quaking with apprehension. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Verily,”</span> said he to himself, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“It is a true saying, <span class="tei tei-q">‘How hardly
        shall they that have <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page80">[pg

        I wonder now, whether I have acted judiciously in entrusting that old
        Ambrussian to Tarsius? If the bishop had been here, I could have
        consulted him.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So a weak, but

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As soon as dusk
        began to veil the sky, Christians in parties of three and four came
        to the house of Baudillas. They belonged for the most part to the
        lowest classes. None were admitted till they had given the
        pass-word.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">An <span lang="la"
        class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=

        and as each tapped, he said in Greek: <span class=

        applicant for admission replied in the same tongue, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“For love is of God.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Owing to the Greek
        element in the province, large at Massilia, Arelate and Narbo, but
        not less considerable at Nemausus, the Hellenic tongue, though not
        generally spoken, was more or less comprehended by all in the towns.
        The Scriptures were read in Greek; there was, as yet, no Italic
        version, and the prayers were recited, sometimes in Greek, sometimes
        in Latin. In preaching, the bishops and presbyters employed the
        vernacular—this was a conglomerate of many tongues and was in
        incessant decomposition, flux, and recomposition. <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page82">[pg 82]</span><a name="Pg082" id="Pg082"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>It was different in every town, and varied
        from year to year.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the
        sub-apostolic church it was customary for a banquet to be held in
        commemoration of the Paschal Supper, early in the afternoon, lasting
        all night, previous to the celebration of the new Eucharistic rite,
        which took place at dawn. The night was spent in hymn singing, in
        discourses, and in prayer.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But even in the
        Apostolic age, as we learn from St. Paul’s first Epistle to the
        Corinthians, great abuses had manifested themselves, and very
        speedily a change was made. The Agape was dissociated from the
        Eucharist and was relegated to the evening after the celebration of
        the Sacrament. It was not abolished altogether, because it was a
        symbol of unity, and because, when under control, it was
        unobjectionable. Moreover, as already intimated, it served a
        convenient purpose to the Christians by making their meetings
        resemble those of the benefit clubs that were under legal
        protection.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It may be
        conjectured that where the bulk of the members were newly converted,
        and were ignorant, there would speedily manifest itself among them a
        tendency to revert to their pagan customs, and a revolt against the
        restraints of Christian sobriety. <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page83">[pg 83]</span><a name="Pg083" id="Pg083" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>And this actually took place, causing much
        embarrassment to the clergy, and giving some handle to the heathen to
        deride these meetings as scenes of gross disorder.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">No sooner did
        persecution cease, and the reason for holding love-feasts no longer
        held, than they were everywhere put down and by the end of the fourth
        century had absolutely ceased.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the third
        century Tertullian, in his <span class="tei tei-q">“Apology”</span>
        addressed to the heathen, gave a rose-colored description of the
        institution; but in his <span class="tei tei-q">“Treatise on
        Fasting”</span> addressed to the faithful, he was constrained to
        admit that it was a nursery of abuses. But this, indeed, common sense
        and a knowledge of human nature would lead us to suspect.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We are prone to
        imagine that the first ages of the Church saw only saints within the
        fold, and sinners without. But we have only to read the writings of
        the early Fathers to see that this was not the case. If we consider
        our mission stations at the present day, and consult our evangelists
        among the heathen, we shall discover that the newly converted on
        entering the Church, bring with them much of their past: their
        prejudices, their superstitions, their ignorance, and their passions.
        The most vigilant care <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page84">[pg
        84]</span><a name="Pg084" id="Pg084" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>has
        to be exercised in watching against relapse in the individual, and
        deterioration of the general tone. The converts in the first ages
        were not made of other flesh and blood than those now introduced into
        the sheepfold, and the difficulties now encountered by missionaries
        beset the first pastors of Christ fifteen and sixteen hundred years
        ago.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In an honest
        attempt to portray the condition of the Church at the opening of the
        third century, we must describe things as they were, and not as we
        should wish them to have been.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The <span lang=
        "la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">atrium</span></span> or courtyard was not
        lighted; there was sufficient illumination from above. The curtains
        of the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
        "la"><span style="font-style: italic">tablinum</span></span> were
        close drawn, as the reception chamber was not to be put in
        requisition that night. The <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign"
        xml:lang="la"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">triclinium</span></span> or dining-room that
        received light through the doorway only would have been dark had not
        a lamp or two been kindled there.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">About thirty
        persons were present, male and female, but no children. Some were
        slaves from believing households; there were a few freedmen. Some
        were poor artisans, weavers, bakers, and men who sold charcoal, a
        porter, and a besom-maker.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Quincta and
        Perpetua were the highest in social position of those present. A
        second deacon, named <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page85">[pg
        85]</span><a name="Pg085" id="Pg085" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>Marcianus, was there, a handsome man, peremptory
        in manner, quick in movement; in every point a contrast with his
        timid, hesitating brother in the ministry.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The bishop had not
        arrived when the Agape began, and the blessing was spoken by an aged
        and feeble presbyter. The tables were spread with viands, and the
        deacons and deaconesses ministered to those who reclined at them.
        There was not room for all in the dining-chamber, and a table and
        couches had been spread in the court for such as could not be
        accommodated within.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The proceedings
        were marked by the strictest propriety, the eating and drinking were
        in moderation, conversation was edifying, and general harmony
        prevailed. During the meal, a knocking was heard at the outer gate,
        and when the porter asked the name of the applicant for admission,
        the password was given, and he was admitted.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All rose to
        receive Castor, the bishop.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Recline again, my friends,”</span> said he. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I have come from the house of Flavillus, the timber
        merchant on the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=

        id="Pg086" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the work of my Master. One, a
        stranger to the faith, questioned me, and I tarried to converse with
        him, and disclose to his dark mind some ray of light. If the supper
        be ended, I will offer thanks.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then, standing at
        one of the tables, he made prayer to God, and thanked Him who had
        caused the corn to spring out of the earth, and had gathered the many
        grains into one bread; who had watered the vine from heaven, and had
        flushed the several grapes with generous juice, uniting the many into
        one bunch.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The thanksgiving
        ended, lights were introduced in considerable numbers. There is no
        twilight in southern climes; when night falls, it falls darkly. Now
        all who had eaten went to the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign"
        xml:lang="la"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">impluvium</span></span>, dipped their hands, and
        washed their lips, then wiped them on towels held by the
        deaconesses.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The tables were
        quickly removed, and the benches ranged in the <span lang="la" class=
        "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">triclinium</span></span>, so as to accommodate
        all.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">No sooner was the
        whole congregation assembled, than the president, Castor, invited all
        such as had a psalm, an interpretation, a vision, or an edifying
        narrative, to relate or recite it.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then up started a
        little man, who held a lyre.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Sir,”</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“I have
        composed a poem in honor of Andeolus, the martyr of
        Gentibus.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He struck a chord
        on his instrument, and sang. The composition was devoid of poetry,
        the meter halting, the Latin full of provincialisms, and the place of
        poetic imagery was filled with extravagances of expression. When he
        had concluded, he perhaps inadvertently wound up with the words,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Generous audience, grant me your
        applause!”</span>—the usual method of conclusion on the stage.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And the request
        met with favor—hands were clapped.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then Bishop Castor
        rose, and with a grave face, said:</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“We have listened to Lartius Garrulus with interest and
        with edification. It is well to glorify the memories of the holy ones
        who have witnessed a good confession, who have fought the fight, and
        have shed their blood as a testimony. But a poet in treating of such
        subjects, should restrain his too exuberant fancy, and not assert as
        facts matters of mere conjecture, nor should he use expressions that,
        though perhaps endurable in poetry, cannot be addressed to the
        martyrs in sober prose. The ignorant are too ready to employ words
        without considering <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page88">[pg
        88]</span><a name="Pg088" id="Pg088" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>their
        meaning with nicety, and to quote poets as licensing them to do that
        which their pastors would forbid.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“But,”</span> said the deacon Marcianus, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“what if this be uttered by inspiration?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The Spirit of God,”</span> answered Castor, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“never inspires the mind to import into religion anything
        that is not true.”</span> Turning round, he said: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I call on Turgellius to interpret a portion of the
        Epistle of the Blessed Paul, the Apostle to the Romans, translating
        it into the vulgar tongue, as there be those present who comprehend
        Greek with difficulty.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This done, one
        rose, and said:</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Sir, suffer me to disclose a revelation. I was asleep on
        my bed, three nights agone, and I had a dream, or vision, from on
        high. I beheld a snow-white flock pasturing on a mountain; there was
        abundance of herbage, and the sky was serene. The shepherd stood
        regarding them, leaning on his staff, and the watch-dog slept at his
        feet in the grass. Then, suddenly, the heavens became obscured,
        lightning flashed, thunder rolled: the flock was terrified and
        scattered. Thereupon came wolves, leaping among the sheep, and
        rending them; and I <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page89">[pg
        89]</span><a name="Pg089" id="Pg089" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>beheld now that some which I had taken to be
        sheep, cast their skins, and disclosed themselves to be ravening
        beasts. What may be signified by the vision, I know not, but I
        greatly fear that it portends an evil time to the Church.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“That is like enough,”</span> said Baudillas,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“after what has occurred this day. If the
        bishop has not heard, I will relate all to him in order.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I have been informed of everything,”</span> said
        Castor.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“It is well that there should be a sifting of the wheat
        from the chaff,”</span> said Marcianus. <span class="tei tei-q">“Too
        long have we had wolves masquerading among us clothed in sheepskins.
        See!”</span> He threw back his mantle, and extended his hand.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“On my way hither, I passed by the fountain
        of Nemausus, and none were there. Then my soul was wrath within me at
        the idolatry and worship of devils that goes on in the temple and
        about the basin. So I took up a stone, and I climbed upon the
        pedestal, and I beat till I had broken this off.”</span> Then he
        rolled an alabaster sculptured head on the floor. With a contemptuous
        kick, he sent it spinning. <span class="tei tei-q">“This is their god
        Nemausus. A deacon of Christ’s Church, with a bit of stone, is able
        to break his neck, and carry off his head!”</span> <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page90">[pg 90]</span><a name="Pg090" id="Pg090"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Then he laughed. But none laughed in
        response.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A thrill of dismay
        ran through the assembly.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A woman fell into
        hysterics and screamed. Some called out that she prophesied, others
        that she spake with tongues. Baudillas appeased the excitement.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“The tongue she speaks,”</span> said he,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“is the Ligurian of the Cebennæ, and all she
        says is that she wishes she were safe with her children in the
        mountains, and had never come into the town. Now, indeed, it seems
        that the evil days foreseen by Pantilius Narbo will come on the
        Church. The people might forget that the god was robbed of his
        victim, but not that his image has been defaced.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Well done, I say!”</span> shouted a man, thrusting
        himself forward. His face was inflamed and his eyes dazed.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“I—I, Tarsius the slave, and Marcianus, the
        deacon, are the only Christians with any pluck about us. Cowards that
        ye all are, quaking at the moment of danger—hares, ye are, hares
        afraid of the whistling of the wind in the grass. I—I——”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Remove that man,”</span> said the bishop. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“He has been drinking.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Remove him,”</span> said the bishop firmly.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Hands were laid on
        the fellow.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then turning to
        Marcianus, Castor said sternly, <span class="tei tei-q">“You have
        acted inconsiderately and wrongly, against the decrees of the
        Fathers.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Thou thyself mayest be strong,”</span> said Castor,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“but thine act will bring the tempest upon

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        storm is none of my brewing. It had arisen before I intervened. The
        escape of the lady Perpetua from the fountain—that was the beginning,
        I have but added the final stroke.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <span class="tei tei-q">“May God, the God of all comfort, strengthen

        Church. The lightnings will indeed flash, the sheep be scattered, and
        those revealed whom we have esteemed to be true disciples of Christ,
        but who are far from Him in heart. Many that are first shall be last,
        and the last first. It is ever so in the Kingdom of
        Christ—hark!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Suddenly a
        strange, a terrible sound was heard—a loud, hoarse note, like a blast
        blown through a triton’s shell, but far louder; it seemed to pass in
        the air over the house, and set the tiles quivering. Every wall
        vibrated to it, and every heart thrilled as well. Men rushed into the
        <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=

        sky. Stars twinkled. Nothing extraordinary was visible. But those who
        looked expected to see some fire-breathing monster flying athwart the
        dark, heavenly vault, braying; and others again cried out that this
        was the trumpet of the archangel, and that the end of all things was
        come.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then said

        not appearing in time at the Agape, Castor had asserted that he had
        been engaged on his Master’s work elsewhere. That was true. He had
        been at the house of the timber merchant as we have seen, and he had
        been detained by Æmilius as he left it. This latter had been lying on

        id="Pg094" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>not, I believe, unknown in
        Nemausus, or at Arelate, where also I have an office. But you, sir,
        may not have heard of me—we have assuredly never met. Your age and
        gravity of demeanor belong to a social group other than mine. You mix
        with the wise, the philosophers, and not with such butterflies as
        myself, who am a ridiculous pleasure seeker—seeking and never
        finding. If I am not in error, you are Castor Lepidus Villoneos, of
        an ancient magisterial family in Nemausus and the reputed head of the
        Christian sect.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        But I pray you to afford me—if thy courtesy will suffer it—some
        information concerning a matter on which I am eager to obtain light.
        I have been in the apartment adjoining that in which the mother of
        the hostess lay, and I chanced—the partition being but of plank—to
        overhear what was said. I confess that I am inquisitive to know
        something more certain of this philosophy or superstition, than what
        is commonly reported among the people. On this account, I venture to
        detain <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page95">[pg 95]</span><a name=

        97]</span><a name="Pg097" id="Pg097" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the
        conviction that there is a future life? Do not you civilized Romans,
        though you have no evidence, act as though there were such a life,
        and testify thereto on your monumental cenotaphs?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        based on no grounds whatever, but a vague longing, unless there were
        such a reality provided for those who have this desire in them? Would
        the Creator of man mock him? Would He put this hunger into him unless
        it were to be satisfied? You have eyes that crave for the light, and
        the light exists that satisfies this longing! You have ears that
        desire sounds, and the world is full of voices that meet this desire.
        Where there is a craving there is ever a reality that corresponds
        with and gives repose to that desire. Look,”</span> said the bishop,
        and pointed to the water in which were reflected the stars that now
        began to glitter in the sky. <span class="tei tei-q">“Do you see all
        those twinkling points in the still water? They correspond to the
        living luminaries set above in the vault. You in your soul have these
        reflections—sometimes seen, sometimes obscured, but ever returning.
        They answer to realities in the celestial world overhead. The
        reflections could not be <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page98">[pg
        98]</span><a name="Pg098" id="Pg098" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>in
        your nature unless they existed in substance above.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“There is a score of other things we long after in vain
        here.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“What things? I believe I know. Purity, perfection,
        justice. Well, you do not find them here entire—only in broken

        exist.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A boat was
        propelled through the water. It broke the reflections, that
        disappeared or were resolved into a very dust of sparkles. As the
        wavelets subsided, however, the reflections reformed.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Castor walked up
        and down beside Æmilius in silence for a few turns, then said:—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The world is full of inequalities and injustices. One
        man suffers privation, another is gorged. One riots in luxury at the
        expense of the weak. Is there to be no righting of wrongs? no justice
        to be ever done? If there be a God over all, He must, if just—and who
        can conceive of God, save as perfectly just?—He must, I say, deal
        righteous judgment and smooth out all these creases; and how can he
        do so, unless there be a condition of existence after death in which
        the wrongs may be redressed, the evil-doers be punished, and tears be
        wiped away?”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page99">[pg

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Have you not in your conscience a sense of right as
        distinct from wrong—obscured often, but ever returning—like the
        reflection of the stars in the water? How comes it there unless there
        be the verities above? Unless your Maker so made you as to reflect
        them in your spirit?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Æmilius said
        nothing.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Have you not in you a sense of the sacredness of Truth,

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Æmilius did not,

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        it not antecedently probable that the God who made man, and put into
        his nature this desire after truth, virtue, holiness, justice, aye,
        and this hunger after immortality, should reveal to man that without
        which man is unable to direct his life aright, attain to the
        perfection of his being, and look beyond death with
        confidence?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“If there were but such a revelation!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I say—is it conceivable that the Creator should not make

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Thou givest me much food for thought,”</span> said the

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Digest it—looking at the reflection of the stars in the
        water—aye! and recall what is told by Aristotle of Xenophanes, how
        that casting his eyes upward at the immensity of heaven, he declared
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The
        One</span></span> is God. That conviction, at which the philosopher

        who set the stars in heaven above, and the lights in thine own dim
        soul.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then the bishop
        sought a boat, and was rowed in the direction of the town.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Æmilius remained
        by the lagoon.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page101">[pg
        101]</span><a name="Pg101" id="Pg101" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Words such as
        these he had heard were novel. The thoughts given him to meditate on
        were so deep and strange that he could not receive them at once.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The night was now
        quite dark, and the stars shone with a brilliancy to which we are
        unaccustomed in the North, save on frosty winter nights.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Milky Way
        formed a sort of crescent to the north, and enveloped Cassiopeia’s
        Chair in its nebulous light. To the west blazed Castor and Pollux,
        and the changing iridescent fire of Algol reflected its varying
        colors in the water.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Æmilius looked up.
        What those points of light were, none could say. How was it that they
        maintained their order of rising and setting? None could answer. Who
        ruled the planets? That they obeyed a law, was obvious, but by whom
        was that law imposed?</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Æmilius paced
        quicker, with folded arms and bowed head, looking into the water. The
        heavens were an unsolved riddle. The earth also was a riddle, without
        interpretation. Man himself was an enigma, to which there was no
        solution. Was all in heaven, in earth, to remain thus locked up,
        unexplained?</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page102">[pg
        102]</span><a name="Pg102" id="Pg102" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">How was it that
        planets and constellations fulfilled the law imposed on them without
        deviation, and man knew not a law, lived in the midst of a cobweb of
        guesses, entangling himself in the meshes of vain speculations, and
        was not shown the commandment he must obey? Why had the Creator
        implanted in his soul such noble germs, if they were not to
        fructify—if only to languish for lack of light?</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again he lifted
        his eyes to the starry vault, and repeated what had been said of
        Xenophanes, <span class="tei tei-q">“Gazing on the immensity of
        heaven, he declared that the One was God.”</span> And then,
        immediately looking down into the depths of his own heart, he added:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“And He is reflected here. Would that I knew
        Him.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Yet how was he to
        attain the desired knowledge? On all sides were religious quacks
        offering their nostrums. What guarantee did Christianity offer, that
        it was other than the wild and empty speculations that swarmed,
        engaged and disappointed the minds of inquirers?</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Unconscious how
        time passed, Æmilius paced the bank. Then he stood still, looking
        dreamily over the calm water. A couple of months more and the
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page103">[pg 103]</span><a name="Pg103"
        id="Pg103" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>air would be alive with
        fire-flies that would cluster on every reed, that would waver in
        dance above the surface of the lagoon, tens of thousands of drifting
        stars reflecting themselves in the water, and by their effulgence
        disturbing the light of the stars also there mirrored.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thinking of this,
        Æmilius laughed.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“So is it,”</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“in
        the world of philosophic thought and religious aspiration. The air is
        full of fire-flies. They seem to be brilliant torch-bearers assuring
        us guidance, but they are only vile grubs, and they float above the
        festering pool that breeds malarial fevers. Where is the truth,
        where?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From the distant
        city sounded a hideous din, like the bellow of a gigantic bull.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Æmilius laughed
        bitterly.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I know what that is, it is the voice of the god—so say
        the priestesses of Nemausus. It is heard at rare intervals. But the

        engaged on the temple and saw how a brazen instrument like a shell of
        many convolutions had been contrived in the walls and concealed, so
        that one woman’s breath could sound it and produce such a bellow as
        would shake the city. Bah! one religion <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Every house in
        Nemausus thrilled with life. Sleep was driven from the drowsiest
        heads. The tipsy were sobered at once. Those banqueting desisted from
        conversation. Music was hushed. Men rushed into the street. The
        beasts in the amphitheater, startled by the strange note, roared and
        howled. Slowly the chief magistrate rose, sent to summon an edile,
        and came forth. He was not quick of movement; it took him some time
        to resolve whether he or his brother magistrate was responsible for
        order; when he did issue forth, then he found the streets full, and
        that all men in them were talking excitedly.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The god Nemausus,
        the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">archegos</span></span>, the divine founder and
        ancestor had spoken. His voice was rarely heard. It was told that
        before the Cimbri and Teutones had swept over the province, he had
        shouted. That had been in ages past; of late he had been sparing in
        the exercise of his voice. He was said to have cried out at the great
        invasion of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page106">[pg
        106]</span><a name="Pg106" id="Pg106" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>Helvetii, that had been arrested by Julius
        Cæsar; again to have trumpeted at the outbreak of Civilis and Julius
        Sabinus, which, however, had never menaced Narbonese Gaul, though at
        the time the god had called the worst was anticipated. The last time
        he had been heard was at the revolt of Vindex that preceded the fall
        of Nero.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Some young
        skeptics whispered: <span class="tei tei-q">“By Hercules, the god has
        a brazen throat.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“It is his hunting horn that peals to call attention.
        What he will say will be revealed to the priestess.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Or what the priestess wishes to have believed is his
        message.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But this
        incredulous mood was exhibited by very few. None ventured openly to
        scoff.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The god hath spoken!”</span> this was the cry through
        the streets and the forum. Every man asked his fellow what it
        signified. Some cried out that the prince—the divine Aurelius
        Antoninus (Caracalla)—had been assassinated, just as he was about to
        start from Rome for Gaul. Others that the privileges of the city and
        colony were going to be abrogated. But one said to his fellow,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“I augured ill when we heard that the god had
        been cheated of his due. No <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page107">[pg
        107]</span><a name="Pg107" id="Pg107" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>marvel he is out of humor, for Perpetua is
        esteemed the prettiest virgin in Nemausus.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I wonder that the rescue passed off without notice being
        taken of the affair by the magistrates.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Bah! it is the turn of the Petronius Alacinus now, and
        he will not bestir himself unnecessarily. So long as the public peace
        be not broken——”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“But it was—there was a riot, a conflict.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“A farcical fight with wind-bags. Not a man was hurt, not
        a drop of blood flowed. The god will not endure to be balked and his
        sacrifice made into a jest.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“What does it all mean?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then said a stout
        man: <span class="tei tei-q">“My good friend, it means that which
        always happens when the priesthood is alarmed and considers that its
        power is menaced—its credit is shaken. It will ask for
        blood.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“There has been a great falling off of late in the
        worshipers of the gods and in attendance at the games.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“This comes of the spread of the pestilent sect of the
        Christians. They are the enemies of the human race. They eat little
        children. The potter Fusius lost his son last week, aged six, and
        they say it was <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page108">[pg

        into it.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Bah! the body was found in the channel of the stream the

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I heard it was found half eaten,”</span> said a
        third.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Rats, rats,”</span> explained another standing by.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Well, these Christians refuse to venerate the images of
        the Augustus, and therefore are foes to the commonwealth. They should
        be rooted out.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“You are right there. As to their religious notions—who
        cares about them? Let them adore what they will—onions like the
        Egyptians, stars like the Chaldeans, a sword like the Scythians—that
        is nothing to us; but when they refuse to swear by the Emperor and to
        offer sacrifice for the welfare of the empire then, I say, they are
        bad citizens, and should be sent to the lions.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The lions,”</span> laughed the stout man, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“seem to respond to the voice, which sounded in their
        ears, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Dinner for you, good beasts!’</span>
        Well, may we have good sport at the games founded by Domitius Afer. I
        love to lie in bed when the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign"
        xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">circius</span></span>
        (mistral) howls and the snowflakes fly. Then one feels snug and
        enjoys the contrast. So in the amphitheater one realizes the
        blessedness of life when one looks on at <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page109">[pg 109]</span><a name="Pg109" id="Pg109" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>wretches in the hug of the bear, or being
        mumbled by lions, or played with by panthers.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Perhaps the only
        man whom the blast did not startle was Tarsius, the inebriated slave,
        who had been expelled the house of Baudillas, and who was engrossed
        only with his own wrongs, and who departed swearing that he
        excommunicated the Church, not the Church him. He muttered threats;
        he stood haranguing on his own virtues, his piety, his generosity of
        spirit; he recorded many acts of charity he had done. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And I—I to be turned out! They are a scurvy lot. Not
        worthy of me. I will start a sect of my own, see if I do
        not.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whilst reeling
        along, growling, boasting, confiding his wrongs to the walls on each
        side, he ran against Callipodius just as the words were in his mouth:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“I am a better Christian than all of them. I
        don’t affect sanctimoniousness in aspect, but I am sound, sound in my
        life—a plain, straight-walking man.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Are you so?”</span> asked Callipodius. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Then I wish you would not festoon in such a manner as to
        lurch against me. You are a Christian. Hard times are coming for such
        as you.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Aye, aye! I am a Christian. I don’t care who

        id="Pg110" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>knows it. I’m not the man to

        they have turned me out.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Callipodius caught
        the fellow by the shoulder and shook him.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Man,”</span> said he. <span class="tei tei-q">“Ah, a
        slave! I recognize you. You are of the family of Julius Largus
        Litomarus, the wool merchant. Come with me. The games are in a few
        days, and the director of the sports has been complaining that he
        wanted more prisoners to cast to the beasts. I have you in the nick
        of time. I heard you with these ears confess yourself to be a
        Christian, and the sole worthy one in the town. You are the man for
        us—plump and juicy, flushed with wine. By the heavenly twins, what a
        morsel you will make for the panthers! Come with me. If you resist I
        will summon the crowd, then perhaps they will elect to have you
        crucified. Come quietly, and it shall be panthers, not the cross. I
        will conduct you direct to the magistrate and denounce
        you.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I pray you! I beseech you! I was talking <span class=

        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>nonsense. I was enacting a part for the
        theater. I am no Christian; I was, but I have been turned out,
        excommunicated. My master and mistress believe, and just to please
        them and to escape stripes, and get a few favors such as are not
        granted to the others, I have—you understand.”</span> The slave
        winked.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Beside Callipodius
        was a lad bearing a torch. He held it up and the flare fell over the
        face of the now sobered Tarsius.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Come with me, fellow,”</span> said Callipodius.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Nothing will save you but perfect obedience
        and compliance with what I direct. Hark! was not that the howl of the
        beasts. Mehercule! they snuff you already. My good friend Æmilius
        Lentulus Varo, the lawyer, will be your patron; a strong man. But you
        must answer my questions. Do you know the Lady Quincta and her
        daughter? Quincta is the widow of Harpinius Læto.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Aye, aye! the wench was fished out of the pond

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Will you denounce them?”</span> asked the slave
        nervously.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“On the contrary. They are menaced. I seek to save
        them.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Oh! if that be all, I am your man. They are in the
        mansion of Baudillas, yonder—that is—but mum, I say! I must not
        speak. They kicked me out, but I am not ungenerous. I will denounce
        nobody. But if you want to save the ladies, I will help you with
        alacrity. They charged me with being drunk—not the ladies—the bishop
        did that—more shame to him. I but rinsed out my mouth with the
        Ambrussian. Every drop clear as amber. Ah, sir! in your cellar have
        you——”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A rush of people
        up the street shouting, <span class="tei tei-q">“The will of the god!
        the will of the god! It is being proclaimed in the forum.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They swept round
        Callipodius and the slave, spinning them, as leaves are spun in a
        corner by an eddy of wind, then swept forward in the direction of the
        great square.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Come aside with me, fellow,”</span> said Callipodius,
        darting after the slave who was endeavoring to slink away.

        marked by a scar.”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Tarsius, at your service, sir!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Good Tarsius, here is money, and I undertake to furnish
        you with a bottle of my best old Ambrussian for your private tipple,
        or to make merry therewith with your friends. Be assured, no harm is
        meant. The priests of Nemausus seek to recover possession of the lady
        Perpetua, and it is my aim to smuggle her away to a place of
        security. Do thou watch the door, and I will run and provide litters
        and porters. Do thou assure the ladies that the litters are sent to
        convey them in safety to where they will not be looked for; say thy
        master’s house. I will answer for the rest. Hast thou access to
        them?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Aye! I know the pass-word. And though I have been
        expelled, yet in the confusion and alarm I may be suffered again to
        enter.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Very excellent. Thou shalt have thy flask and an ample
        reward. Say that the litters are sent by thy master, Largus
        Litomarus.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Right, sir! I will do thy bidding.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then Callipodius
        hastened in the direction of the habitation of Æmilius.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Meanwhile the
        forum filled with people, crowding on one another, all quivering with
        excitement. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page114">[pg
        114]</span><a name="Pg114" id="Pg114" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>Above were the stars. Here and there below,
        torches. Presently the chief magistrate arrived with his lictors, and
        a maniple of soldiers to keep order and make a passage through the
        mob between the Temple of Nemausus and the forum.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Few women were
        present. Such as were, belonged to the lowest of the people. But
        there were boys and men, old and young, slaves, artisans, freedmen,
        and citizens.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among the ignorant
        and the native population the old Paganism had a strong hold, and
        their interests attached a certain number of all classes to it. But
        the popular Paganism was not a religion affecting the lives by the
        exercise of moral control. It was devoid of any ethic code. It
        consisted in a system of sacrifice to obtain a good journey, to ward
        off fevers, to recover bad debts, to banish blight and mildew. The
        superstitious lived in terror lest by some ill-considered act, by
        some neglect, they should incur the wrath of the jealous gods and
        bring catastrophe on themselves or their town. They were easily
        excited by alarm, and were unreasonable in their selfish fervor.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Ever in
        anticipation of some disaster, an earthquake, a murrain, fire or
        pestilence, they were ready <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page115">[pg
        115]</span><a name="Pg115" id="Pg115" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>to
        do whatever they were commanded, so as to avert danger from
        themselves. The words of the Apostle to the Hebrews describing the
        Gentiles as being through fear of death all their lifetime subject to
        bondage, were very true. The ignorant and superstitious may be said
        to have existed on the verge of a panic, always in terror lest their
        gods should hurt them, and cringing to them in abject deprecation of
        evil. It was this fear for themselves and their substance that
        rendered them cruel.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The procession
        came from the temple. Torches were borne aloft, a long wavering line
        of lurid fire, and vessels were carried in which danced lambent
        flames that threw out odoriferous fumes.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">First came the
        priests; they walked with their heads bowed and their arms folded
        across their breasts, and with fillets of wool around their heads.
        Then followed the priestesses shrouded in sable mantles over their
        white tunics. All moved in silence. A hush fell on the multitude.
        Nothing was heard in the stillness save the tramp of feet in rhythm.
        When the procession had reached the forum, the chief priestess
        ascended the rostrum, and the flambeau-bearers ranged themselves in a
        half-circle below. She was a tall, splendidly formed <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page116">[pg 116]</span><a name="Pg116" id="Pg116"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>woman, with profuse dark hair, an ivory
        complexion, flashing black eyes under heavy brows.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Suddenly she
        raised her arms and extended them, letting the black pall drop from
        her shoulders, and reveal her in a woven silver robe, like a web of
        moonlight, and with white bare arms. In her right she bore an ivory
        silver-bound wand with mistletoe bound about it, every berry of
        translucent stone.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then amidst dead
        silence she cried: <span class="tei tei-q">“The god hath spoken, he
        who founded this city, from whom are sprung its ancient patrician
        families, who supplieth you with crystal water from his urn. The holy
        one demands that she who hath been taken from him be surrendered to
        him again, and that punishment be inflicted on the Christians who
        have desecrated his statue. If this, his command, be not fulfilled,
        then will he withhold the waters, and deliver over the elect city to
        be a desolation, the haunt of the lizard and the owl and bat. To the

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With the exception
        of the bishop, Marcianus, and a few others, all assembled at the
        Agape were struck with the liveliest terror. They entertained no
        doubt but that the sound that shook the walls was provoked by the
        outrage on the image of the tutelary god, following on the rescue of
        the victim <a name="corr117" id="corr117" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">allotted</span> to
        him.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The pagan
        inhabitants of Nemausus were roused to exasperation. The priesthood
        would employ every available means to work this resentment to a
        paroxysm, and the result would be riot and murder, perhaps an
        organized persecution.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It must be
        understood that although the Roman State recognized other religions
        than the established paganism, as that of the Jews, and allowed the
        votaries freedom of worship, yet Christianity was not of this number.
        It was in itself illegal, and any magistrate, at his option, in any
        place and at any time, might put the laws in force against the
        members of the Church. Not only so, but any envious, <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page118">[pg 118]</span><a name="Pg118" id="Pg118"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>bigoted, or resentful person might compel
        a magistrate to take cognizance of the presence of Christians in the
        district under his jurisdiction, and require him to capitally convict
        those brought before him.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The system in the
        Roman Commonwealth for the maintenance of order was that every man
        was empowered to act as spy upon and delate another. Any man might
        accuse his neighbor, his brother, before the court; and if he could
        prove his charge, the magistrate had no option—he must sentence.
        Consequently the Christians depended for their safety on the favor of
        their fellow-citizens, on their own abstention from giving
        offence.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The sole
        protection against false accusations in the Roman Commonwealth lay in
        the penalties to which an accuser was subject should he fail to
        establish his charge. But as on conviction a portion of the estate of
        the guilty person was handed over to the accuser, there was an
        inducement to delation.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Under the Julian
        and Claudian Cæsars the system had worked terribly. An entire class
        of men made denunciation their trade. They grew rich on the spoils of
        their victims, they spared none, and the judges themselves lived in
        fear of them. The evil became so intolerable that measures were taken
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page119">[pg 119]</span><a name="Pg119"
        id="Pg119" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>to accentuate the risk to the
        accusers. If the Christians were not oftener denounced, the reason
        was that in the event of one lapsing, and through terror or pain
        abjuring Christ, then immediately the tables were turned, and the
        accuser was placed in danger of his life.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When an Emperor
        issued an edict against the Christians he enacted no new law; he
        merely required that the <a name="corr119" id="corr119" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">existing</span> laws
        should be put in force against them, and all risk to delators was
        removed in that no delation was exacted. On such an occasion every
        citizen and householder was required to appear before the court and
        offer a few grains of incense on an altar to the genius of the empire
        or of the prince. Should any one refuse to do this, then he was
        convicted of high treason and delivered over to the executioner to be
        either tortured or put to death off-hand. When the magistrate deemed
        it important to obtain a recantation, then he had recourse to the
        rack, iron hooks, torches, thumbscrews as means of forcing the
        prisoner through pain to abjure Christ.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Christians in
        Nemausus had lived in complete tranquillity. There had been no
        persecution. They had multiplied.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page120">[pg 120]</span><a name="Pg120" id="Pg120" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The peace enjoyed
        by the Church had been to it of a mixed advantage. Many had been
        included whose conversion was due to questionable motives. Some had
        joined through sincere conviction; more from conviction seasoned with
        expectation of advantage. The poor had soon learned that a very rich
        and abundant stream of charity flowed in the Church, that in it the
        sick and feeble were cared for and their necessities were supplied,
        whereas in the established paganism no regard was paid to the needy
        and suffering. Among the higher classes there were adherents who
        attached themselves to the Church rather because they disbelieved in
        heathenism than that they held to the Gospel. Some accepted the truth
        with the head, but their hearts remained untouched.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">None had given
        freer expression to his conviction that there were weak-kneed and
        unworthy members than Marcianus the deacon. He had remonstrated with
        the bishop, he had scolded, repelled, but without effect. And now he
        had taken a daring step, the consequence of which would be that the
        members of the community would indeed be put to the test whether they
        were for Christ or Mammon. The conviction that a time of trial was
        come broke on <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page121">[pg
        121]</span><a name="Pg121" id="Pg121" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the
        community like a thundercloud, and produced a panic. Many doubted
        their constancy, all shrank from being brought to a trial of their
        faith. The congregation in the house of Baudillas, when it had
        recovered from the first shock, resolved itself into groups agitated
        by various passions. Some launched into recrimination against
        Marcianus, who had brought them into jeopardy; some consulted in
        whispers how to escape the danger; a few fell into complete
        stupefaction of mind, unable to decide on any course. Others, again,
        abandoned themselves to despair and shrieked forth hysterical
        lamentations. Some crowded around Castor, clung to his garments and
        entreated him to save them. Others endeavored to escape from a place
        and association that would compromise them, by the back entrance to
        the servants’ portion of the house.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A few, a very few
        maintained their composure, and extending their arms fell to
        prayer.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Baudillas hurried
        from one party to another uttering words of reassurance, but his face
        was blanched, his voice quivered, and he was obviously employing
        formal expressions that conveyed no strength to his own heart.
        Marcianus, with folded arms, looked at him scornfully, and as he
        passed, said, <span class="tei tei-q">“The bishop <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page122">[pg 122]</span><a name="Pg122" id="Pg122"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>should not have ordained such an unstable
        and quaking being as thyself to serve in the sacred
        ministry.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Ah, brother,”</span> sighed Baudillas, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“it is with me as with Peter. The spirit truly is
        willing, but the flesh is weak.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“That was spoken of him,”</span> answered Marcianus,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“before Pentecost and the outpouring of the
        spirit of strength. Such timidity, such feebleness are unworthy of a
        Christian.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Pray for me that my faith fail not,”</span> said
        Baudillas, and passed on. By action he deadened his fears. Now came
        in Pedo, the old servant of the house, who had been sent forth to
        reconnoiter. His report was not reassuring. The mob was sweeping
        through the streets, and insisting on every household producing an
        image at its doors and placing a light before it. There were fuglemen
        who directed the crowd, which had been divided into bands to
        perambulate every division of the town and make inquisition of every
        house. The mob had begun by breaking into such dwellings as were not
        protected by an image, and wrecking them. But after one or two of
        such acts of violence, the magistrates had interfered, and although
        they suffered the people to assemble before the houses and to clamor
        for the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page123">[pg 123]</span><a name=
        "Pg123" id="Pg123" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>production of an image
        and a light, yet they sent <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign"
        xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">vigiles</span></span>
        (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the watch) to guard such
        dwellings as remained undecorated. When the master of the house
        refused obedience to the mandate of the mob, then an officer ordered
        him to open the door, and he summoned him to appear next day in court
        and there do sacrifice. By this means the mob was satisfied and
        passed on without violence.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But as the crowd
        marched down the streets it arrested every man and woman that was
        encountered, and insisted on their swearing by the gods and
        blaspheming Christ.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Castor ordered the
        congregation to depart by twos and by threes, to take side alleys,
        and to avoid the main thoroughfares. This was possible, as the
        <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">posticum</span></span>, a back door,
        communicated with a mean street that had the city wall for one
        side.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“My sons and daughters in Christ,”</span> said the bishop
        with composure, <span class="tei tei-q">“remember that greater is He
        that is with us than those that be against us. When the servant of
        Elisha feared, then the Lord opened his eyes that he might behold the
        angels with chariots and horses of fire prepared to defend His
        servant. Avoid danger, but if it cannot be avoided stand firm.
        Remember His words, <span class="tei tei-q">‘He that con<span class=

        confess before my Father which is in heaven.’</span> ”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As soon as all had
        departed, but not till then, did Castor leave. Marcianus turned with
        a sneer to his fellow-deacon and said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Fly!
        you have full license from the bishop; and he sets the example
        himself.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I must tarry in my own house,”</span> answered
        Baudillas. <span class="tei tei-q">“I have the ladies Quincta and

        they be fetched.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <span class="tei tei-q">“Master, there is the freedwoman Glyceria
        below, who comes in charing. She has brought an idol of Tarranus
        under her cloak, and offers to set that with a lamp before the door.
        She is not a believer, she worships devils, but is a good soul and
        would save us. She awaits your permission.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The deacon was
        profoundly moved.</p>

        not asked my leave, and had—if—but no, I cannot sanction this. God
        strengthen me, I am distracted and weak.”</span> The slave remained.
        He expected that his master in the end would yield.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        a dishonor to the Church. He that confesseth me before men—no, no,

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <span class="tei tei-q">“They are at the door.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Blows resounded
        through the house, and the roar of voices from the street surged up

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The deacon
        ascended a flight of limestone steps to the upper story. The slabs
        were worn and cracked, and had not been repaired owing to his
        poverty. He entered a room that looked out on the street, and went to
        the window.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The street above
        his doorway was dense with people, below it was completely empty.
        Torches threw up a glare illumining the white façades of the houses.
        He saw a sea of heads below. He heard the growl of voices breaking
        into a foam of coarse laughter. Curses uttered against the
        Christians, blasphemies against Christ, words of foulness, threats,
        brutal jests, formed the matter of the hubbub below. A man bearing a
        white wand with a sprig of artificial mistletoe at the end, gave
        directions to the people where to go, where to stop, what to do. He
        was the head of the branch of the guild of the Cultores Nemausi for
        that portion of the town.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Someone in the mob
        lifting his face, looked up and saw the deacon at the window, and at
        once shouted, <span class="tei tei-q">“There! there he is! Baudillas
        Macer, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page131">[pg 131]</span><a name=
        "Pg131" id="Pg131" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>come down, sacrilegious
        one! That is he who carried the maiden away.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then rose hoots
        and yells, and a boy putting his hands together and blowing produced
        an unearthly scream.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“He is one of them! He is a ringleader! He has an ass’s
        head in the house to which he sacrifices our little ones. He it was
        who stuck needles into the child of the potter Fusius, and then
        gnawed off the cheeks and fingers. He can inform where is the
        daughter of Aulus Harpinius who was snatched from the basin of the
        god. Let us avenge on him the great sacrilege that has been
        committed. It was he who struck off the head of the god.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then one flung a
        stone that crashed into the room, and had not Baudillas drawn back,
        it would have struck and thrown him down stunned.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Let the house be ransacked!”</span> yelled the mob.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“We will seek in it for the bones of the

        a ladder, we will enter by the windows. Someone ascend to the roof

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then ensued a rush
        against the valves, but they were too solid to yield; and the bars
        held them <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page132">[pg
        132]</span><a name="Pg132" id="Pg132" class=

        solid wall.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The slave Pedo now
        knocked on the inside. This was the signal that he was about to
        open.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The soldiers drew
        up across the entrance, and when the door was opened, suffered none
        to enter the house save the deputy of the prefect with four of his
        police, and some of the leaders of the Cultores Nemausi. And now a
        strange calm fell on the hitherto troubled spirit of Baudillas. He
        was aware that no effort he could make would enable him to escape.
        His knees, indeed, shook under him as he went to the stairs to
        descend, and forgetting that the tenth step was broken, he stumbled
        at it and was nearly precipitated to the bottom. Yet all wavering,
        all hesitation in his mind was at an end.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He saw the men in
        the court running about, calling to each other, peering into every
        room, cubicle, and closet; one called that the cellar was the place
        in which the infamous rites of the Christians were performed and that
        there would be found amphoræ filled with human blood. Then one
        shouted that in the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
        "la"><span style="font-style: italic">tablinum</span></span> there
        was naught save a small table. Immediately after a howl rose from
        those who had <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page133">[pg
        133]</span><a name="Pg133" id="Pg133" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>penetrated to the <span lang="la" class=
        "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">triclinium</span></span>, and next moment they
        came rushing forth in such excitement that they dragged down the
        curtain that hung before the door and entangled their feet in it.
        One, not staying to disengage himself, held up his hands and
        exhibited the broken head of the statue, that had been brought there
        by Marcianus, and by him left on the floor.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“It is he who has done it! The sacrilegious one! The
        defacer of the holy image!”</span> howled the men, and fell upon the
        deacon with their fists. Some plucked at his hair; one spat in his
        face. Others kicked him, and tripping him up, cast him his length on
        the ground, where they would have beaten and trampled the life out of
        him, had not the deputy of the ædile interfered, rescued him from the
        hands of his assailants and thrust him into a chamber at the side of
        the hall, saying: <span class="tei tei-q">“He shall be brought before
        the magistrate. It is not for you to take into your hands the
        execution of criminals untried and uncondemned.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then one of the
        officers of the club ran to the doorway of the house, and cried:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Citizens of Nemausus, hearken. The author of
        the egregious impiety has been discovered. It is Cneius Baudillas
        Macer, who belongs to an ancient, though decayed, <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page134">[pg 134]</span><a name="Pg134" id="Pg134"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>family of this town. He who should have
        been the last to dishonor the divine founder has raised his
        parricidal hand against him. He stands convicted. The head of the god
        has been found in the house; it is that recently broken off from the
        statue by the baths. Eheu! Eheu! Woe be to the city, unless this
        indignity be purged away.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A yell of
        indignation rose as an answer.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The slave Pedo was
        suffered to enter the bedroom, on the floor of which lay his master
        bruised and with his face bleeding; for some of his front teeth had
        been broken and his lips were cut.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Oh master! dear master! What is to be done?”</span>
        asked the faithful creature, sobbing in his distress.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I wonder greatly, Pedo, how I have endured so much. My
        fear is lest in the end I fall away. I enjoin you—there is naught
        else you can do for me—seek the bishop, and ask that the prayers of
        the Church may go up to the Throne of Grace for me. I am feeble and
        frail. I was a frightened shy lad in old times. If I were to fall, it
        would be a shame to the Church of God in this town, this Church that
        has so many more worthy than myself in it.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Can I bring thee aught, master? Water and a
        towel?”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page135">[pg
        135]</span><a name="Pg135" id="Pg135" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Nay, nothing, Pedo! Do as I bid. It is all that I now
        desire.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The soldiers
        entered, raised the deacon, and made him walk between them. A man was
        placed in front, another behind to protect him against the people. As
        Baudillas was conveyed down the <span lang="la" class=
        "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">ostium</span></span>, the passage to the door,
        he could see faces glowering in at him; he heard angry voices howling
        at him; an involuntary shrinking came over him, but he was
        irresistibly drawn forward by the soldiers. On being thrust through
        the doorway before all, then a great roar broke forth, fists and
        sticks were shaken at him, but none ventured to cast stones lest the
        soldiers should be struck.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One portion of the
        mob now detached itself from the main body, so as to follow and
        surround the deacon and assure itself that he did not escape before
        he was consigned to the prison.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The city of
        Nemausus, capital of the Volcæ Arecomici, though included
        geographically in the province of Narbonese Gaul, was in fact an
        independent republic, not subject to the proconsul, but under Roman
        suzerainty. With twenty-four <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign"
        xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">comæ</span></span> or
        townships under it, it governed itself by popular election, and
        enjoyed the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
        "la"><span style="font-style: italic">lex Italica</span></span>. This
        little <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page136">[pg 136]</span><a name=
        "Pg136" id="Pg136" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>republic was free from
        land tax, and it was governed by four functionaries, the
        Quatuor-viri, two of whom looked after the finances, and two, like
        the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
        "la"><span style="font-style: italic">duum-viri</span></span>
        elsewhere, were for the purpose of maintaining order, and the
        criminal jurisdiction was in their hands. Their title in full was
        <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">duum viri juri dicendo</span></span>, and they
        were annually elected by the senate. Their function was much that in
        small of the Roman consuls, and they were sometimes in joke entitled
        consuls. They presided over the senate and had the government of the
        town and state in their hands during their tenure of office. On
        leaving their office they petitioned for and received the right to
        ride horses, and were accounted knights. They wore the dignified
        <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">præ texta</span></span>, and were attended by
        two lictors.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Baudillas walked
        between his escort. He was in a dazed condition. The noise, the
        execrations cast at him, the flashing of the torches on the helmets
        and breastplates of the guard, the glittering eyes and teeth of the
        faces peering at him, the pain from the contusions he had received
        combined to bewilder him. In the darkness and confusion of his brain,
        but one thought remained permanent and burnt like a brilliant light,
        his belief in Christ, and one desire <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page137">[pg 137]</span><a name="Pg137" id="Pg137" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>occupied his soul, to be true to his faith. He
        was too distracted to pray. He could not rally his senses nor fix his
        ideas, but the yearning of his humble soul rose up, like the steam
        from a new turned glebe in the sun of a spring morning.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In times of
        persecution certain strong spirits had rushed to confession and
        martyrdom in an intoxication of zeal, such as Baudillas could not
        understand. He did not think of winning the crown of martyrdom, but
        he trembled lest he should prove a castaway.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thrust forward,
        dragged along, now stumbling, then righted by the soldiers sustaining
        him, Baudillas was conveyed to the forum and to the basilica where
        the magistrate was seated.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On account of the
        disturbance, the Duum-vir—we will so term him though he was actually
        one of the Quatuor-viri—he whose turn it was to maintain order and
        administer justice, had taken his place in the court, so as to be
        able to consign to custody such as were brought in by the guard on
        suspicion of being implicated in the outrage; he was there as well
        for the purpose of being ready to take measures promptly should the
        mob become unmanageable. So long as it was under control, he did not
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page138">[pg 138]</span><a name="Pg138"
        id="Pg138" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>object to its action, but he
        had no thought of letting it get the upper hand. Rioters, like
        children, have a liking for fire, and if they were suffered to apply
        their torches to the houses of Christians might produce a general
        conflagration.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Although the
        magistrates were chosen by popular election, it was not those who
        constituted the rabble who had votes, and had to be humored, but the
        citizen householders, who viewed the upheaval of the masses with
        jealous suspicion.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That the
        proceedings should be conducted in an orderly manner, instructions
        had been issued that no arrest was to be made without there being
        someone forthcoming to act as accuser, and the soldiers were enjoined
        to protect whosoever was menaced against whom no one was prepared to
        formulate a charge which he would sustain in court.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the case of
        Baudillas there would be no difficulty. The man—he was the treasurer
        of the guild—who had found the mutilated head was ready to appear
        against him.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The court into
        which the deacon was brought rapidly filled with a crowd, directly he
        had been placed in what we should now call the dock. Then the accuser
        stood up and gave his name. The magis<span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page139">[pg 139]</span><a name="Pg139" id="Pg139" class=

        accuser made oath that he acted from no private motive of hostility
        to the accused, and that he was not bribed by a third person to
        delate him. This done, he proceeded to narrate how he had entered the
        house of Baudillas, surnamed Macer, who was generally believed to be
        a minister of the sect of the Christians; how that in searching the

        "font-style: italic">triclinium</span></span>. He further stated that
        he well knew the statue of the god Nemausus that stood by the
        fountain which supplied the lower town, and that he was firmly
        convinced that the head which he now produced had belonged to the
        statue, which statue had that very night been wantonly and impiously
        defaced. He therefore concluded that the owner of the house,
        Baudillas Macer, was either directly or indirectly guilty of the act
        of sacrilege, and he demanded his punishment in accordance with the
        law.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This sufficed as
        preliminary.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Baudillas was now

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Perpetua was
        carried along at a swinging trot in the closed litter, till the end
        of the street had been reached, and then, after a corner had been
        turned, the bearers relaxed their pace. It was too dark for her to
        see what were the buildings past which she was taken, even had she
        withdrawn the curtains that shut in the litter; but to withdraw these
        curtains would have required her to exert some force, as they were
        held together in the grasp of Tarsius, running and striding at the
        side. But, indeed, she did not suppose it necessary to observe the
        direction in which she was being conveyed. She had accepted in good
        faith the assurance that the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign"
        xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">lectica</span></span>
        had been sent by the rich Christian wool merchant, Largus Litomarus,
        and had acquiesced in her mother’s readiness to accept the offer,
        without a shadow of suspicion.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">God had delivered
        her from a watery death, and she regarded the gift as one to be
        respected; her life thus granted her was not to be wilfully thrown
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page141">[pg 141]</span><a name="Pg141"
        id="Pg141" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>away or unnecessarily
        jeopardized. Unless she escaped from the house of the deacon, she
        would fall into the hands of the rabble, and this was a prospect more
        terrifying than any other. If called upon again to witness a good
        confession, she would do so, God helping her, but she was glad to be
        spared the ordeal.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was not till
        the porters halted, and knocked at a door, and she had descended from
        the palanquin, that some suspicion crossed her mind that all was not
        right. She looked about her, and inquired for her mother. Then one
        whom she had not hitherto noticed drew nigh, bowing, and said:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Lady, your youthful and still beautiful
        mother will be here presently. The slaves who carry her have gone
        about another way so as to divert attention from your priceless self,
        should any of the mob have set off in pursuit.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The tone of the
        address surprised the girl. Her mother was not young, and although in
        her eyes that mother was lovely, yet Quincta was not usually
        approached with expressions of admiration for her beauty.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again Perpetua
        accepted what was said, as the reason given was plausible, and
        entered the house. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page142">[pg
        142]</span><a name="Pg142" id="Pg142" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>The
        first thing she observed, by the torch glare, was a statue of Apollo.
        She was surprised, and inquired, hesitatingly, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Is this the house of Julius Largus
        Litomarus?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Admirable is your ladyship’s perspicuity. Even in the
        dark those more-than-Argus eyes discern the truth. The worthy citizen
        Largus belongs to the sect. He is menaced as well as other excellent
        citizens by the unreasoning and irrational vulgar. He has therefore
        instructed that you should be conveyed to the dwelling of a friend,
        only deploring that it should be unworthy of your
        presence.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        "tei tei-q">“I do not remember to have heard the name, but,”</span>
        she added with courtesy, <span class="tei tei-q">“that is due to my
        ignorance as a young girl, or to my defective memory.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“It is a name that has not deserved to be harbored in the
        treasury of such a mind.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The girl was
        uneasy. The fulsome compliment and the obsequious bow of the speaker
        were not merely repugnant to her good taste, but filled her with
        vague misgivings. It was true that exaggeration and flattery in
        address were common enough <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page143">[pg
        143]</span><a name="Pg143" id="Pg143" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>at
        the period, but not among Christians, who abstained from such
        extravagance. The mode of speaking adopted by Callipodius stamped him
        as not being one of the faithful.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I will summon a female slave to attend on your

        The entire contents of the house are at your disposal.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        elsewhere; but, under no circumstances short of being absolutely
        prevented from joining you, will she fail to meet you to-morrow in
        the villa Ad Fines.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Whose villa?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        of Proserpine by Ceres were being rehearsed, were it not that the
        daughter is seeking the mother as well as the latter her incomparable
        child.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I cannot go to Ad Fines without her.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Lady, in all humility, as unworthy to advise you in
        anything, I would venture to suggest that your safety depends on
        accepting the means of escape that are offered. The high priestess
        has declared that nothing will satisfy the incensed god but that you
        should be surrendered to her, and what mercy you would be likely to
        encounter at her hands, after what has taken place, your penetrating
        mind will readily perceive. Such being the case, I dare recommend
        that you snatch at the opportunity offered, fly the city and hide in
        the villa of a friend who will die rather than surrender you. None
        will suspect that you are there.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“What friend? Largus Litomarus is scarcely to be termed
        an acquaintance of my mother.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Danger draws close all generous ties,”</span> said
        Callipodius.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        that her presence along with you would <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        "tei tei-anchor"></a>increase the danger to yourself. I do not say
        so. But it may so happen that her absence at this moment may be due
        to her good judgment. On the other hand, it may also have chanced, as
        I already intimated, that her litter has been stayed, and she has
        been constrained to sacrifice.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“That she will never do.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“In that case, I shudder at the consequences. But why
        suppose the worst? She has been delayed. And now, lady, suffer me to
        withdraw—it is an eclipse of my light to be beyond the radiance of
        your eyes. I depart, however, animated by the conviction, and winging
        my steps, that I go to perform your dearest wish—to obtain
        information relative to your lady mother, and to learn when and where
        she will rejoin you. Be ready to start at dawn—as soon as the city
        gates are opened, and that will be in another hour.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then Perpetua
        resigned herself to the female servants, who led her into the inner
        and more private portions of the house, reached by means of a passage
        called <span class="tei tei-q">“the Jaws”</span> (<span lang="la"
        class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">fauces</span></span>).</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Perpetua was aware
        that she was in a difficult situation, one in which she was unable to
        know how she was placed, and from which she could not
        extri<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page146">[pg 146]</span><a name=
        "Pg146" id="Pg146" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>cate herself. She was
        young and inexperienced, and, on the whole, inclined to trust what
        she was told.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In pagan Rome, it
        was not customary for girls to be allowed the liberty that alone
        could give them self-confidence. Perhaps the condition of that evil
        world was such that this would not have been possible. When the
        foulest vice flaunted in public without a blush, when even religion
        demoralized, then a Roman parent held that the only security for the
        innocence of a daughter lay in keeping her closely guarded from every
        corrupting sight and sound. She was separated from her brothers and
        from all men; she associated with her mother and with female slaves
        only. She was hardly allowed in the street or road, except in a
        litter with curtains close drawn, unless it were at some religious
        festival or public ceremony, when she was attended by her relatives
        and not allowed out of their sight.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This was due not
        merely to the fact that evil was rampant, but also to the conviction
        in the hearts of parents that innocence could be preserved only by
        ignorance. They were unable to supply a child with any moral
        principle, to give it any law for the government of life, which would
        plant the best guardian of virtue within, in the
        heart.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page147">[pg
        147]</span><a name="Pg147" id="Pg147" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Augustus, knowing
        of no divine law, elevated sentimental admiration for the simplicity
        of the ancients into a principle—only to discover that it was
        inadequate to bear the strain put on it; that the young failed to
        comprehend why they should control their passions and deny themselves
        pleasures out of antiquarian pedantry. Marcus Aurelius had sought in
        philosophy a law that would keep life pure and noble, but his son
        Commodus cast philosophy to the winds as a bubble blown by the breath
        of man, and became a monster of vice. Public opinion was an unstable
        guide. It did worse than fluctuate, it sank. Much was tolerated under
        the Empire that was abhorrent to the conscience under the Republic.
        It allowed to-day what it had condemned yesterday. It was a nose of
        wax molded by the vicious governing classes, accommodated to their
        license.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Although a
        Christian maiden was supplied with that which the most exalted
        philosophy could not furnish—a revealed moral code, descending from
        the Creator of man for the governance of man, yet Christian parents
        could not expose their children to contamination of mind by allowing
        them the wide freedom given at this day to an English or American
        girl. Moreover, the customs of social life had to be <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page148">[pg 148]</span><a name="Pg148" id="Pg148"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>complied with, and could not be broken
        through. Christian girls were accordingly still under some restraint,
        were kept dependent on their parents, and were not allowed those
        opportunities for free action which alone develop individuality and
        give independence of character. Nevertheless, in times of
        persecution, when many of these maidens thus closely watched were
        brought to the proof of their faith, they proved as strong as men—so
        mighty was the grace of God, so stubborn was faith.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Although Perpetua
        was greatly exhausted by the strain to which she had been exposed
        during the day, she could not rest when left to herself in a quiet
        room, so alarmed was she at the absence of her mother.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">An hour passed,
        then a second. Finally, steps sounded in the corridor before her
        chamber, and she knew that she must rise from the couch on which she
        had cast herself and continue her flight.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A slave presented
        herself to inform Perpetua that Callipodius had returned with the
        tidings that her mother was unable at once to rejoin her, that she
        was well and safe, and had preceded her to Ad Fines; that she desired
        her daughter to follow with the utmost expedition, and that she was
        impatient <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page149">[pg
        149]</span><a name="Pg149" id="Pg149" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>to
        embrace her. The slave woman added that the streets were now quiet,
        the city gates were open, and that the litter was at the door in
        readiness.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I will follow you with all speed. Leave me to
        myself.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then, when the
        slave had withdrawn, Perpetua hastily arranged her ruffled hair,
        extended her arms, and turning to the east, invoked the protection of
        the God who had promised, <span class="tei tei-q">“I will never leave
        thee, nor forsake thee.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On descending to
        the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
        "la"><span style="font-style: italic">atrium</span></span>, Perpetua
        knelt by the water-tank and bathed her face and neck. Then she
        mounted the litter that awaited her outside the house. The bearers at
        once started at a run, nor did they desist till they had passed
        through the city gate on the road that led to the mountain range of
        the Cebennæ. This was no military way, but it led into the pleasant
        country where the citizens of Nemausus and some of the rich merchants
        of Narbo had their summer quarters.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The gray dawn had
        appeared. Market people from the country were coming into the town
        with their produce in baskets and carts.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The bearers jogged
        along till the road ascended <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page150">[pg 150]</span><a name="Pg150" id="Pg150" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>with sufficient rapidity to make them short of
        breath. The morning was cold. A streak of light lay in the east, and
        the wind blew fresh from the same quarter. The colorless white dawn
        overflowed the plain of the Rhodanus, thickly strewn with olives,
        whose gray foliage was much of the same tint as the sky overhead. To
        the south and southeast the olive plantations were broken by tracts
        of water, some permanent lagoons, others due to recent inundations.
        To the right, straight as an arrow, white as snow, ran the high road
        from Italy to Spain, that crossed the Rhodanus at Ugernum, the modern
        Beaucaire, and came from Italy by Tegulata, the scene of the victory
        of Marius over the Cimbri, and by Aquæ Sextiæ and its hot
        springs.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The journey was
        long; the light grew. Presently the sun rose and flushed all with
        light and heat. The chill that had penetrated to the marrow of the
        drowsy girl gave way. She had refused food before starting; now, when
        the bearers halted at a little wayside tavern for refreshment and
        rest, she accepted some cakes and spiced wine from the fresh
        open-faced hostess with kindly eyes and a pleasant smile, and felt
        her spirits revive. Was she not to rejoin her dear mother? Had she
        not escaped with <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page151">[pg
        151]</span><a name="Pg151" id="Pg151" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>her
        life from extreme peril? Was she not going to a place where she would
        be free from pursuit?</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She continued her
        journey with a less anxious heart. The scenery improved, the heights
        were wooded, there were juniper bushes, here and there tufts of pale
        helebore.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then the litter
        was borne on to a terrace before a mass of limestone crag and forest
        that rose in the rear. A slave came to the side of the palanquin and
        drew back the curtain. Perpetua saw a bright pretty villa, with
        pillars before it forming a peristyle. On the terrace was a fountain
        plashing in a basin.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Lady,”</span> said the slave, <span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Baudillas found
        that there were already many in the prison, who had been swept
        together by the mob and the soldiers, either for having refused to
        produce an image, or for having declined to sacrifice. To his no
        small surprise he saw among them the wool-merchant Julius Largus
        Litomarus. The crowd had surrounded his house, and as he had not
        complied with their demands, they had sent him to the duumvir,<a id=

        Atacinus, who had consigned him to prison till, at his leisure, he
        could investigate the charge against him.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The two
        magistrates who sat in court and gave sentence were Petronius
        Atacinus and Vibius Fuscianus, and they took it in turns to sit, each
        being the acting magistrate for a month, when he was succeeded by the
        other. Atacinus was a humane man, easy-going, related to the best
        families in the place, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page153">[pg
        153]</span><a name="Pg153" id="Pg153" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and
        acquainted with such as he was not allied with by blood or marriage.
        His position, in face of the commotion relative to the mutilation of
        the image and the rescue of Perpetua, was not an easy one.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Rome and in
        every other important city, the <span lang="la" class=
        "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">flamen</span></span>, or chief priest, occupied
        a post of considerable importance and influence. He sat in the seat
        at the games and in the theater next to the chief magistrates, and
        took precedence over every other officer in the town. Nemausus had
        such a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
        "la"><span style="font-style: italic">flamen</span></span>, and he
        was not only the official religious head in the place, but was also
        the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
        "la"><span style="font-style: italic">flamen
        Augustalis</span></span>, the pontiff connected with the worship of
        Augustus, which had become the predominant cult in Narbonese Gaul,
        and also head of the College of the Augustals, that comprised the
        very powerful body of freedmen. The priestess of the divine founder
        and giver of the fountain shared his dignity and authority. Between
        them they could exercise a preponderating power in the town, and it
        would be in vain for Petronius Atacinus, however easy-going he might
        be, and disinclined to shed blood, to pass over what had been done
        without affording satisfaction to the pagan party moved and held
        together by the priesthood.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Yet the duumvir
        judged that it would be emi<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page154">[pg
        154]</span><a name="Pg154" id="Pg154" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>nently unadvisable for him to proceed with too
        great severity, and to punish too many persons. Christianity had many
        adherents in the place, and some of these belonged to the noble,
        others to the mercantile, families. The general wish among the
        well-to-do was that there should be no systematic persecution. An
        inquisitorial search after Christians would break up families, rouse
        angry passions, and, above all, disturb business.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Petronius had
        already resolved on his course. He had used every sort of evasion
        that could be practiced. He had knowingly abstained from enjoining on
        the keepers of the city gates the requisition of a passport from such
        as left the town. The more who fled and concealed themselves, the
        better pleased would he be.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nevertheless, he
        had no thought of allowing the mutilation of the statue to pass
        unpunished, and he was resolved on satisfying the priesthood by
        restoring Perpetua to them. If he were obliged to put any to death,
        he would shed the blood only of such as were inconsiderable and
        friendless.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There was another
        element that entered into the matter, and which helped to render
        Atacinus inclined to leniency. The Cæsar at the time was M.
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page155">[pg 155]</span><a name="Pg155"
        id="Pg155" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Aurelius Antoninus, commonly
        known as Caracalla. He had been brought up from infancy by a
        Christian nurse, and was thought to harbor a lurking regard for the
        members of the religion of Christ. At any rate, he displayed no
        intolerance towards those who professed it. He was, himself, a
        ferocious tyrant, as capricious as he was cruel. He had murdered his
        brother Geta in a fit of jealousy, and his conscience, tortured by
        remorse, drove him to seek relief by prying into the mysteries of
        strange religions.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The duumvir
        Atacinus was alive to the inclinations and the temper of the prince,
        and was the more afraid of offending him by persecution of the
        Christians, as the Emperor was about shortly to visit Gaul, and might
        even pass through Nemausus.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If in such a
        condition of affairs the Christians were exposed to danger, it may
        well be inferred that, where it was less favorable, their situation
        was surrounded with danger. They were at all times liable to fall
        victims to popular tumults, occasioned sometimes by panic produced by
        an earthquake, by resentment at an accidental conflagration which the
        vulgar insisted on referring to the Christians, sometimes by distress
        at the breaking out of an epidemic. <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page156">[pg 156]</span><a name="Pg156" id="Pg156" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>On such occasions the unreasoning rabble
        clamored that the gods were incensed at the spread of the new
        atheism, and that the Christians must be cast to the lions.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When Baudillas saw
        the wool merchant in the prison, he went to him immediately.
        Litomarus was sitting disconsolately on a stone bench with his back
        against the prison wall.</p>

        We loved that child. We were wrapped up in her. Marcianus said that
        we made of the little creature an earthly idol, and that it was right
        she should be taken away. I do not know. She had such winning ways.

        is like floss silk.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The wool merchant
        was too greatly absorbed in his own troubles to give attention to the
        matter that <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page158">[pg
        158]</span><a name="Pg158" id="Pg158" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>had
        been broached by the deacon. Baudillas withdrew to another part of
        the prison in serious concern.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When day broke,
        Litomarus was released. His brother was a pagan and had easily
        satisfied the magistrate. This brother was in the firm, and traveled
        for it, buying fleeces from the shepherds on the limestone plateaux
        of Niger and Larsacus. He had been away the day before, but on his
        return in the morning, on learning that Julius was arrested, he spoke
        with the duumvir, presented him with a ripe ewe’s milk cheese just
        brought by him from Larsacus, and obtained the discharge of Julius
        without further difficulty.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Baudillas remained
        in prison that morning, and it was not till the afternoon that he was
        conducted into court. By this time the duumvir was tired and
        irritable. The <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
        "la"><span style="font-style: italic">flamen</span></span> had
        arrived and had spoken with Atacinus, and complained that no example
        had been made, that the Christians were being released, and that,
        unless some sharp punishments were administered, the people, incensed
        at the leniency that had been exhibited, would break out in uproar
        again. Petronius Atacinus, angry, tired out, hungry and peevish, at
        once sent for the deacon.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The head of the
        god had been found in his house, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page159">[pg 159]</span><a name="Pg159" id="Pg159" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>and he had been seen conveying the rescued
        virgin from the fountain, and must certainly know where she was
        concealed.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was noticeable
        that nothing had been said about the punishing of Æmilius. Even the
        god, as interpreted by the priestess, had made no demand that he
        should be dealt with; in fact, had not mentioned him. The duumvir
        perfectly understood this reticence. Æmilius Lentulus belonged to a
        good family in the upper town, and to that most powerful and dreaded
        of all professions—the law. Even the divine founder shrank from
        attacking a member of the long robe, and a citizen of the upper
        town.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When Baudillas
        appeared in court, the magistrate demanded an explanation of the fact
        of the broken head being found in his house, and further asked of him
        where Perpetua was concealed.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Baudillas would
        offer no explanation on the first head; he could not do so without
        incriminating his brother in the ministry. He denied that he had
        committed the act of violence, but not that he knew who had
        perpetrated the outrage. As to where Perpetua was, that he could not
        say, because he did not know. His profession of ignorance was not
        believed. He was threatened with torture, but in <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page160">[pg 160]</span><a name="Pg160" id="Pg160"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>vain. Thereupon the duumvir sentenced him
        to be committed to the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign"
        xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">robur</span></span>,
        and consigned to the lowest depth thereof, there to remain till such
        time as he chose to reveal the required information.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then Petronius
        Atacinus turned and looked at the <span lang="la" class=
        "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">flamen</span></span> with a smile, and the
        latter responded with a well-satisfied nod.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A Roman prison
        consisted of several parts, and the degree of severity exercised was
        marked by the portion of the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign"
        xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">carcer</span></span>
        to which the prisoner was consigned. Roman law knew nothing of
        imprisonment for a term as a punishment. The <span lang="la" class=
        "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">carcer</span></span> was employed either as a
        place for temporary detention till trial, or else it was one for
        execution.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The most tolerable
        portion of the jail consisted of the outer court, with its cells, and
        a hall for shelter in cold and wet weather. This was in fact the
        common <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
        "la"><span style="font-style: italic">atrium</span></span> on an
        enlarged scale and without its luxuries. But there was another part
        of the prison entitled the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign"
        xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">robur</span></span>,
        after the Tullian prison at Rome. This consisted of one large vaulted
        chamber devoid of window, accessible only by the door, through the
        interstices of which alone light and air could enter. It derived its
        name from oak beams planted against the walls, to which were attached
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page161">[pg 161]</span><a name="Pg161"
        id="Pg161" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>chains, by means of which
        prisoners were fastened to them. In the center of the floor was a
        round hole, with or without a low breastwork, and this hole
        communicated with an abyss sometimes given the Greek name of
        <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">barathrum</span></span>, with conical dome, the
        opening being in the center. This pit was deep in mire. Into it
        flowed the sewage of the prison, and the outfall was secured by a
        grating.<a id="noteref_7" name="noteref_7" href=

        Athens, in which certain malefactors were smothered.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When Jeremiah was
        accused before King Zedekiah of inciting the people to come to terms

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Then took they Jeremiah, and cast him into the dungeon
        of Malchiah, that was in the court of the prison, and they let down
        Jeremiah with cords. And in the dungeon there was no water, but mire;
        so Jeremiah sunk in the mire.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When Paul and
        Silas were at Philippi, they were imprisoned in the superior portion
        of the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=

        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page162">[pg 162]</span><a name="Pg162"

        the other prisoners were in the outer portion, that was more
        comfortable, and where they had some freedom of movement.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Baudillas turned
        gray with horror at the thought of being consigned to the awful
        abyss. His courage failed him and he lost power in his knees, so that
        he was unable to sustain himself, and the jailer’s assistants were
        constrained to carry him.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As he was conveyed
        through the outer court, those who were awaiting their trial crowded
        around him, to clasp and kiss his hand, to encourage him to play the
        man for Christ, and to salute him reverently as a martyr.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One man, turning

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As Baudillas was
        supported through the doorway into the inner prison, he turned his
        head and looked at the brilliant sky above the yard wall. Then the
        door was shut and barred behind him. All, however, was not absolutely
        dark, for there was a gap, through which two fingers could be thrust,
        under the door, and the sun lay on the threshold and sent a faint
        reflection through the chamber.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nevertheless, on
        entering from the glare of the sun, it seemed to Baudillas at first
        as though he were plunged in darkness, and it was not for some
        moments that he could distinguish the ledge that surrounded the
        well-like opening. The jailer now proceeded to strike a light, and
        after some trouble and curses, as he grazed his knuckles, he
        succeeded in kindling a lamp. He now produced a rope, and made a loop
        at one end about a short crosspole.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Sit astride on that,”</span> said he
        curtly.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page164">[pg

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Baudillas
        complied, and with his hands grasped the cord.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then slowly he was
        lowered into the pitch blackness below. Down—down—down he descended,
        till he plashed into the mire.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The jailer holding
        the lamp, looked down and called to him to release the rope. The
        deacon obeyed. There he stood, looking up, watching the dancing pole
        as it mounted, then saw the spark of the lamp withdrawn; heard the
        retreating steps of the jailer, then a clash like thunder. The door
        of the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=

        He was alone at the bottom of this fetid abyss.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then he said, and
        tears coursed down his cheeks as he said it: <span class=

        darkness and in the grave.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On account of the
        death in the family of the timber merchant, Æmilius left the house
        and took a room and engaged attendance in the cottage of a cordwainer
        a little way off. The house was clean, and the good woman was able to
        cook him a meal not drowned in oil nor rank with garlic.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He was uneasy
        because Callipodius did not return, and he obtained no tidings
        concerning Perpetua. The image of this maiden, with a face of
        transparent purity, out of which shone the radiance of a beautiful
        soul, haunted his imagination and fluttered his heart. He walked by
        the side of the flooded tract of land, noticed that the water was
        falling, and looked, at every turn he took, in the direction of
        Nemausus, expecting the arrival of his client, but always in
        vain.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He did at length
        see a boat approach, towards evening, and he paced the little
        landing-place with quick strides till it ran up against it; and then
        only, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page166">[pg 166]</span><a name=
        "Pg166" id="Pg166" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>to his disappointment,
        did he see that Callipodius was not there. Castor disembarked.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the strength of
        his slight acquaintance Æmilius greeted the bishop. The suspense was
        become unendurable. He asked to be granted a few words in private. To
        this Castor gladly consented.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He, the head of
        the Christian community, had remained unmolested. He belonged to a
        senatorial family in the town, and had relations among the most
        important officials. The duumvir would undoubtedly leave him alone
        unless absolutely obliged to lay hands on him. Nemausus was divided
        into two towns, the Upper and the Lower, each with its own
        water-supply, its own baths, and each distinct in social
        composition.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The lower town,
        the old Gallic city, that venerated the hero-founder of the same name
        as the town, was occupied by the old Volcian population and by a vast
        number of emancipated slaves of every nationality, many engaged in
        trade and very rich. These freedmen were fused into one <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“order,”</span> as it was termed, that of the <span lang=
        "la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Liberti</span></span>.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The upper town
        contained the finest houses, and was inhabited by the Roman
        colonists, by some descendants of the first Phocean settlers, and by
        such <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page167">[pg 167]</span><a name=
        "Pg167" id="Pg167" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of the old Gaulish
        nobility as had most completely identified themselves with their
        conquerors. These had retained their estates and had enriched
        themselves by taking Government contracts.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such scions of the
        old Gaulish houses had become fused by marriage and community of
        interest with the families of the first colonists, and they affected
        contempt for the pure-blooded old aristocracy who had sunk into
        poverty and insignificance in their decayed mansions in Lower
        Nemausus.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Of late years,
        slowly yet surely, the freedmen who had amassed wealth had begun to
        invade superior Nemausus, had built themselves houses of greater
        magnificence and maintained an ostentatious splendor that excited the
        envy and provoked the resentment of the old senatorial and knightly
        citizens.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The great natural
        fountain supplied the lower town with water, but was situated at too
        low a level for the convenience of the gentry of Upper Nemausus, who
        had therefore conveyed the spring water of Ura from a great distance
        by tunneling mountains and bridging valleys, and thus had furnished
        themselves with an unfailing supply of the liquid as necessary to a
        Roman as was the air he <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page168">[pg
        168]</span><a name="Pg168" id="Pg168" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>breathed. Thus rendered independent of the
        natural fountain at the foot of the rocks in Lower Nemausus, those
        living in the higher town affected the cult of the nymph Ura, and
        spoke disparagingly of the god of the old town; whereas the inferior
        part of the city clung tenaciously to the divine Nemausus, whose
        basin, full of unfailing water, was presented to their very lips and
        had not to be brought to them from a distance by the engineering
        skill of men and at a great cost.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Devotion to the
        god of the fountain in Lower Nemausus was confined entirely to the
        inhabitants of the old town, and was actually a relic of the old
        Volcian religion before the advent of the colonists, Greek and Roman.
        It had maintained itself and its barbarous sacrifice intact,
        undisturbed.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">No victim was
        exacted from a family of superior Nemausus. The contribution was
        drawn from among the families of the native nobility, and it was on
        this account solely that the continuance of the septennial sacrifice
        had been tolerated.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Already, however,
        the priesthood was becoming aware that a strong feeling was present
        that was averse to it. The bulk of the well-to-do population had no
        traditional reverence for the Gaulish founder-<span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page169">[pg 169]</span><a name="Pg169" id="Pg169"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>god, and many openly spoke of the devotion
        of a virgin to death as a rite that deserved to be abolished.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From the
        cordwainer Æmilius had heard of the mutilation of the statue and of
        the commotion it had caused. This, he conjectured, accounted for the
        delay of Callipodius. It had interfered with his action; he had been
        unable to learn what had become of the damsel, and was waiting till
        he had definite tidings to bring before he returned. Æmilius was
        indignant at the wanton act of injury done to a beautiful work of art
        that decorated one of the loveliest natural scenes in the world. But
        this indignation was rendered acute by personal feeling. The
        disturbance caused by the rescue of the virgin might easily have been
        allayed; not so one provoked by such an act of sacrilege as the
        defacing of the image of the divine founder. This would exasperate
        passions and vastly enhance the danger to Perpetua and make her
        escape more difficult.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As Æmilius walked
        up from the jetty with the bishop, he inquired of him how matters
        stood with the Christians in the town and received a general answer.
        This did not satisfy the young lawyer, and, as the color suffused his
        face, he asked particu<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page170">[pg
        170]</span><a name="Pg170" id="Pg170" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>larly after Perpetua, daughter of the deceased
        Harpinius Læto.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The bishop turned
        and fixed his searching eyes on the young man.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Why make you this inquiry?”</span> he asked.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Surely,”</span> answered Æmilius, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I may be allowed to feel interest in one whom I was the
        means of rescuing from death. In sooth, I am vastly concerned to
        learn that she is safe. It were indeed untoward if she fell once more
        into the hands of the priesthood or into those of the populace. The
        ignorant would grip as hard as the interested.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“She is not in the power of either,”</span> answered
        Castor. <span class="tei tei-q">“But where she is, that God knows,
        not I. Her mother is distracted, but we trust the maiden has found a
        refuge among the brethren, and for her security is kept closely
        concealed. The fewer who know where she is the better will it be,
        lest torture be employed to extort the secret. The Lady Quincta
        believes what we have cause to hope and consider probable. This is
        certain: if she had been discovered and given up to the magistrate
        the fact would be known at once to all in the place.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“To break the image of the god was a wicked <span class=

        irritably. <span class="tei tei-q">“Is such conduct part of your
        religion?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The act was that of a rash and hot-headed member of our
        body. It was contrary to my will, done without my knowledge, and
        opposed to the teaching of our holy fathers, who have ever dissuaded
        from such acts. But in all bodies of men there are hot-heads and
        impulsive spirits that will not endure control.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Your own teaching is at fault,”</span> said Æmilius
        peevishly. <span class="tei tei-q">“You denounce the gods, and yet
        express regret if one of you put your doctrine in
        practice.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“If images were ornaments only,”</span> said the bishop,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“then they would be endurable; but when they
        receive adoration, when libations are poured at their feet, then we
        forbid our brethren to take part in such homage, for it is idolatry,
        a giving to wood and stone the worship due to God alone. But we do
        not approve of insult offered to any man’s religion. No,”</span> said
        Castor emphatically; <span class="tei tei-q">“Christianity is not
        another name for brutality, and that is brutality which insults the
        religious sentiment of the people, who may be ignorant but are

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They had reached
        the rope-walk. The cordwainer was absent.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Let us take a turn,”</span> said the bishop; and then he
        halted and smiled and extended his palm to a little child that ran up
        to him and put its hand within his with innocent confidence.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“This,”</span> said Castor, <span class="tei tei-q">“is

        Speak only when spoken to.”</span> He again addressed the lawyer:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“My friend, if I may so call thee, thou art
        vastly distressed at the mutilation of the image. Why so?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Because it is a work of art, and that particular statue
        was the finest example of the sculpture of a native artist. It was a

        his limbs have grown in suppleness and grace and strength; how his

        situated as you are, but one into which, if man could mount, then he

        comport with divinity. Has any of your gods manifested himself and
        left such a record of his appearance as is fairly certain? If he
        appeared, or was fabled to have appeared, did he tell men anything
        about the nature of God, His will, and the destiny of man? A
        revelation must be in agreement with the highest aspirations of man.
        It must be such as will regulate his life, and conduce to his
        perfection and the advantage of the community. It must be such as
        will supply him with a motive for rejecting what is base, but
        pleasing to his coarse nature, and striving after that which is
        according to the luminous ideal that floats before him. Now the
        Christian revelation answers these conditions, and is therefore
        probably true. It supplies man with a reason why he should contend
        against all that is gross in his nature; should be gentle, courteous,
        kindly, merciful, pure. It does more. It assures him that the Creator
        made man in order that he might strive after this ideal, and in so
        doing attain to serenity and happiness. No other religion that I know
        of makes such claims; no other professes to have been revealed to man
        as the law of his being by Him who made man. No other is so
        completely in accordance on the one hand <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Baudillas had been
        lowered into the pit of the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign"
        xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">robur</span></span>,
        and he sank in the slime half-way up his calves. He waded with
        extended arms, groping for something to which to cling. He knew not
        whether the bottom were even, or fell into deep holes, into which he
        might stumble. He knew not whether he were in a narrow well or in a
        spacious chamber.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Cautiously, in
        obscurity, he groped, uncertain even whether he went straight or was
        describing a curve. But presently he touched the wall and immediately
        discovered a bench, and seated himself thereon. Then he drew up his
        feet out of the mire, and cast himself in a reclining position on the
        stone seat.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He looked up, but
        could not distinguish the opening by which he had been let down into
        the horrible cess-pit. He was unable to judge to what depth he had
        been lowered, nor could he estimate the extent of the dungeon in
        which he was confined.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page190">[pg
        190]</span><a name="Pg190" id="Pg190" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The bench on which
        he reposed was slimy, the walls trickled with moisture, were
        unctuous, and draped with a fungous growth in long folds. The whole
        place was foul and cold.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">How long would his
        confinement last? Would food, pure water be lowered to him? Or was he
        condemned to waste away in this pit, from starvation, or in the
        delirium of famine to roll off from his shelf and smother in the
        mire?</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After a while his
        eyes became accustomed to the dark and sensitive to the smallest
        gradations in it; and then he became aware of a feeble glowworm light
        over the surface of the ooze at one point. Was it that some fungoid
        growth there was phosphorescent? Or was it that a ray of daylight
        penetrated there by some tortuous course?</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After long
        consideration it seemed to him probable that the light he
        distinguished might enter by a series of reflections through the
        outfall. He thought of examining the opening, but to do so he would
        be constrained to wade. He postponed the exploration till later. Of
        one thing he was confident, that although a little sickly light might
        be able to struggle into this horrible dungeon, yet no means of
        egress for the person would be left. Precautions <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page191">[pg 191]</span><a name="Pg191" id="Pg191"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>against escape by this means would
        certainly have been taken.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The time passed
        heavily. At times Baudillas sank into a condition of stupor, then was
        roused to thought again, again to lapse into a comatose condition.
        His cut lip was sore, his bruises ached. He had passed his tongue
        over his broken teeth till they had fretted his tongue raw.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The feeble light
        at the surface became fainter, and this was finally extinguished. The
        day was certainly at an end. The sun had set in the west, an auroral
        glow hung over the place of its decline. Stars were beginning to
        twinkle; the syringa was pouring forth its fragrance, the flowering
        thorns their too heavy odor. Dew was falling gently and cool.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The deacon raised
        his heart to God, and from this terrible pit his prayer mounted to
        heaven; a prayer not for deliverance from death, but for grace to
        endure the last trial, and if again put to the test, to withstand
        temptation. Then he recited the evening prayer of the Church, in
        Greek: <span class="tei tei-q">“O God, who art without beginning and
        without end, the Maker of the world by Thy Christ, and the sustainer
        thereof, God and Father, Lord of the spirit, King of all <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page192">[pg 192]</span><a name="Pg192" id="Pg192"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>things that have reason and life! Thou who
        hast made the day for the works of light, and the night for the
        refreshment of our infirmity, for the day is Thine, the night is
        Thine: Thou hast prepared the light and the sun—do Thou now, O Lord,
        lover of mankind, fountain of all good, mercifully accept this our
        evening thanksgiving. Thou who hast brought us through the length of
        the day, and hast conducted us to the threshold of night, preserve us
        by Thy Christ, afford us a peaceful evening, and a sinless night, and
        in the end everlasting life by Thy Christ, through whom be glory,
        honor and worship in the Holy Spirit, for ever, amen.”</span><a id=
        "noteref_8" name="noteref_8" href="#note_8"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">8</span></span></a> After
        this prayer Baudillas had been wont in the church to say,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Depart in peace!”</span> and to dismiss the
        faithful. Now he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Into Thy hands I
        commend my spirit.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Out of that fetid
        abyss and its horrible darkness rose the prayer to God, winged with
        faith, inspired by fervor sweet with humility, higher than the
        soaring lark, higher than the faint cloud that caught the last rays
        of the set sun, higher than the remotest star.</p><span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page193">[pg 193]</span><a name="Pg193" id="Pg193"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Presently a
        confused sound from above reached the prisoner, and a spot of orange
        light fell on the water below. Then came a voice ringing hollow down
        the depth, and echoed by the walls, <span class="tei tei-q">“Thy
        food!”</span> A slender rope was sent down, to which was attached a
        basket that contained bread and a pitcher of water. Baudillas stepped
        into the ooze and took the loaf and the water vessel.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then the jailer
        called again: <span class="tei tei-q">“To-morrow morning—if more be
        needed—I will bring a second supply. Send up the empty jar when I
        lower that which is full, if thou art in a condition to require
        it.”</span> He laughed, and the laugh resounded as a bellow in the
        vaulted chamber.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Few were the words
        spoken, and they ungracious. Yet was the deacon sensible of pleasure
        at hearing even a jailer’s voice breaking the dreadful silence. He
        waded back to his ledge, ate the dry bread and drank some of the
        water. Then he laid himself down again. Again the door clashed,
        sending thunders below, and once more he was alone.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As his hand
        traveled along the wall it encountered a hard round knot. He drew his
        hand away precipitately, but then, moved by curiosity, groped for it
        again. Then he discovered that this seeming ex<span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page194">[pg 194]</span><a name="Pg194" id="Pg194"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>crescence was a huge snail, there
        hibernating. He dislodged it, threw it from him and it plashed into
        the mire.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Time dragged. Not
        a sound could be heard save the monotonous drip of some leak above.
        Baudillas counted the falling drops, then wearied of counting, and
        abandoned the self-imposed task.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now he heard a
        far-away rushing sound, then came a blast of hot vapor blowing in his
        face. He started into a sitting posture, and clung to his bench. In
        another moment he heard the roar of water that plunged from above;
        and a hot steam enveloped him. What was the signification of this?
        Was the pit to be flooded with scalding water and he drowned in it?
        In a moment he had found the explanation. The water was being let off
        from the public baths. There would be no more bathers this night. The
        tide of tepid water rose nearly level with the ledge on which he was
        crouching, and then ebbed away and rolled forth at the vent through
        which by day a pale halo had entered.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Half suffocated,
        part stupefied by the warm vapor, Baudillas sank into a condition
        without thought, his eyes looking into the blackness above, his ears
        hearing without noting the dribble from the drain <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page195">[pg 195]</span><a name="Pg195" id="Pg195"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>through which the flood had spurted.
        Presently he was roused by a sense of irritation in every nerve, and
        putting his hand to his face plucked away some hundred-legged
        creature, clammy and yet hard, that was creeping over him. It was
        some time before his tingling nerves recovered. Then gradually torpor
        stole over him, and he was perhaps unconscious for a couple of hours,
        when again he was roused by a sharp pain in his finger, and starting,
        he heard a splash, a rush and squeals. At once he knew that a swarm
        of rats had invaded the place. He had been bitten by one; his start
        had disconcerted the creatures momentarily, and they had scampered
        away.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Baudillas remained
        motionless, save that he trembled; he was sick at heart. In this
        awful prison he dared not sleep, lest he should be devoured
        alive.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Was this to be his
        end—to be kept awake by horror of the small foes till he could endure
        the tension no longer, and then sink down in dead weariness and blank
        indifference on his bench, and at once be assailed from all sides, to
        feel the teeth, perhaps to attempt an ineffectual battle, then to be
        overcome and to be picked to his bones?</p><span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page196">[pg 196]</span><a name="Pg196" id="Pg196" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As he sat still,
        hardly breathing, he felt the rats again. They were rallying, some
        swimming, some swarming up on to the shelf. They rushed at him with
        the audacity given by hunger, with the confidence of experience, and
        the knowledge of their power when attacking in numbers.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He cried out, beat
        with his hands, kicked out with his feet, swept his assailants off
        him by the score; yet such as could clung to his garment by their
        teeth and, not discomfited, quickly returned. To escape them he
        leaped into the mire; he plunged this way, then that; he returned to
        the wall; he attempted to scramble up it beyond their reach, but in
        vain.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Wherever he went,
        they swam after him. He was unarmed, he could kill none of his
        assailants; if he could but decimate the horde it would be something.
        Then he remembered the pitcher and felt for that. By this time he had
        lost his bearings wholly. He knew not where he had left the vessel.
        But by creeping round the circumference of his prison, he must
        eventually reach the spot where he had previously been seated, and
        with the earthenware vessel he would defend himself as long as he was
        able.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page197">[pg
        197]</span><a name="Pg197" id="Pg197" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whilst thus
        wading, he was aware of a cold draught blowing in his face, and he
        knew that he had reached the opening of the sewer that served as
        outfall. He stooped and touched stout iron bars forming part of a
        grating. He tested them, and assured himself that they were so thick
        set that it was not possible for him to thrust even his head between
        them.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All at once the
        rats ceased to molest him. They had retreated, whither he could not
        guess, and he knew as little why. Possibly, they were shrewd enough
        to know that they had but to exercise patience, and he must
        inevitably fall a prey to their teeth.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Almost
        immediately, however, he was aware of a little glow, like that of a
        spark, and of a sound of splashing. He was too frightened, too giddy,
        to collect his thoughts, so as to discover whence the light
        proceeded, and what produced the noise.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Clinging to the
        grating, Baudillas gazed stupidly at the light, that grew in
        brightness, and presently irradiated a face. This he saw, but he was
        uncertain whether he actually did see, or whether he were a prey to
        an illusion.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then the light
        flashed over him, and his eyes after <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        Pedo. A hand on the further side grasped one of the stanchions, and
        the deacon heard the question, <span class="tei tei-q">“Master, are
        you safe?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        on thy side. I will rasp on the other. In time we shall cut through
        the iron, and then thou wilt be able to escape. When I heard whither
        thou hadst been cast, then I saw my way to making an effort to save
        thee.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Pedo! I will give thee thy liberty!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Master! it is I who must first manumit thee.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then the slave
        began to file, and as he filed he muttered, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“What is liberty to me? At one time, indeed! Ah, at one
        time, when I was young, and so was Blanda! But now I am old and lame.
        I am well treated by a good master. Well, well! Sir! work at the bar
        where I indicate with my finger. That is a transversal stanchion and
        sustains the others.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Hope of life
        returned. The heart of Baudillas <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page199">[pg 199]</span><a name="Pg199" id="Pg199" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>was no longer chilled with fear and his brain
        stunned with despair. He worked hard, animated by eagerness to
        escape. There was a spring of energy in the little flame of the lamp,
        an inspiring force in the presence of his slave. The bar was thick,
        but happily the moisture of the place and the sour exhalations had
        corroded it, so that thick flakes of rust fell off under the
        tool.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Yesterday, nothing could have been done for you,
        sir,”</span> said Pedo, <span class="tei tei-q">“for the inundation
        was so extensive that the sewer was closed with water that had risen
        a foot above the opening into the river. But, thanks be to God, the
        flood has fallen. Those who know the sky declare that we shall have a
        blast of the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
        "la"><span style="font-style: italic">circius</span></span> (the
        mistral) on us suddenly, and bitter weather. The early heat has
        dissolved the snows over-rapidly and sent the water inundating all
        the low land. Now with cold, the snows will not melt.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Pedo,”</span> said the deacon, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“hadst thou not come, the rats would have devoured me.
        They hunted me as a pack of wolves pursue a deer in the
        Cebennæ.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        distance.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Pedo,”</span> whispered Baudillas again, after a pause,
        whilst both worked at the bar. <span class="tei tei-q">“I know not
        how it was that when I stood before the duumvir, I did not betray my
        Heavenly Master. I was so frightened. I was as in a dream. They may
        have thought me firm, but I was in reality very weak. Another moment,
        or one more turn of the rack and I would have fallen.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Master! God’s strength is made perfect in
        weakness.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Yes, it is so. I myself am a poor nothing. Oh, that I

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        will yield.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Pedo removed the
        lamp that he had suspended by a hook from the crossbar. Baudillas
        threw himself with his full weight against the grating, and the
        stanchion did actually snap under the impact, at the place where
        filed.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“That is well,”</span> said the slave. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Thy side of the bar is also nearly rasped through. Then
        we must saw across this upright staff of iron. To my thinking it is
        not fastened below.”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page201">[pg 201]</span><a name="Pg201" id="Pg201" class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“It is not. I have thrust my foot between it and the
        paving. Methinks it ends in a spike and barbs.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“If it please God that we remove the grating, then thou
        must follow me, bending low.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Is the distance great?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Sixty-four paces of thine; of mine, more, as I do but
        hobble.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Hah! this is ill-luck.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With the energy of
        filing, and owing to the loosened condition of the bar, the lamp had
        been displaced, and it fell from where it had been suspended and was
        extinguished in the water.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Both were now
        plunged in darkness as of Erebus, and were moreover exposed to danger
        from the rats. But perhaps the grating of the files, or the whispers
        of the one man to the other, alarmed the suspicious beasts, and they
        did not venture to approach.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Press, master! I will pull,”</span> said the slave. His
        voice quivered with excitement.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Baudillas applied
        his shoulder to the grating, and Pedo jerked at it sharply.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With a crack it
        yielded; with a plash it fell into the water.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Quick, my master—lay hold of my belt and <span class=

        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>follow. Bow your head low or you will
        strike the roof. We must get forth as speedily as may be.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Pedo! the jailer said that if alive I was to give a sign
        on the morrow. He believes that during the night I will be devoured
        by rats, as doubtless have been others.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Those executed in the prison are cast down
        there.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Perhaps,”</span> said Baudillas, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“if he meet with no response in the morning he will
        conclude that I am dead, and I do not think he will care to descend
        and discover whether it be so.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After a short
        course through the arched passage, both stood upright; they were to
        their breasts in water, but the water was fresh and pure. Above their
        heads was the vault of heaven, not now spangled with stars but
        crossed by scudding drifts of vapor.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Both men scrambled
        out of the river to the bank, and then Baudillas extended his arms,
        and said, with face turned to the sky:</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I waited patiently for the Lord, and He inclined unto

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Perpetua, at Ad
        Fines, was a prey to unrest. She was in alarm for the safety of her
        mother, and she was disconcerted at having been smuggled off to the
        house of a man who was a stranger, though to him she owed her
        life.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The villa was in a
        lovely situation, with a wide outstretch of landscape before it to
        the Rhône, and beyond to the blue and cloudlike spurs of the Alps;
        and the garden was in the freshness of its first spring beauty. But
        she was in too great trouble to concern herself about scenery and
        flowers. Her thoughts turned incessantly to her mother. In the
        embarrassing situation in which she was—and one that was liable to
        become far more embarrassing—she needed the support and counsel of
        her mother.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Far rather would
        she have been in prison at Nemausus, awaiting a hearing before the
        magistrate, and perhaps condemnation to death, than be as at present
        in a charming country house, attended by obsequious servants,
        provided with every comfort, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page205">[pg 205]</span><a name="Pg205" id="Pg205" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>yet ignorant why she had been brought there, and
        what the trials were to which she would be subjected.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The weather had
        changed with a suddenness not infrequent in the province. The warm
        days were succeeded by some of raging wind and icy rains. In fact,
        the mistral had begun to blow. As the heated air rose from the stony
        plains, its place was supplied by that which was cold from the snowy
        surfaces of the Alps, and the downrush was like that to which we
        nowadays give the term of blizzard. So violent is the blast on these
        occasions that the tillers of the soil have to hedge round their
        fields with funereal cypresses, to form a living screen against a
        wind that was said, or fabled, to have blown the cow out of one
        pasture into that of another farmer, but which, without fable, was
        known to upset ricks and carry away the roofs of houses.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To a cloudless
        sky, traversed by a sun of almost summer brilliancy, succeeded a
        heaven dark, iron-gray, with whirling vapors that had no contour, and
        which hung low, trailing their dripping skirts over the shivering
        landscape.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Trees clashed
        their boughs. The wood behind the villa roared like a cataract. In
        the split ledges and prongs of limestone, among the box-bushes and
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page206">[pg 206]</span><a name="Pg206"
        id="Pg206" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>junipers, the wind hissed and
        screamed. Birds fled for refuge to the eaves of houses or to holes in
        the cliffs. Cattle were brought under shelter. Sheep crouched dense
        packed on the lee side of a stone wall. The very ponds and lagoons
        were whipped and their surfaces flayed by the blast. Stones were
        dislodged on the mountain slopes, and flung down; pebbles rolled
        along the plains, as though lashed forward by whips. The penetrating
        cold necessitated the closing of every shutter, and the heating of
        the hypocaust under the house. In towns, in the houses of the better
        classes, the windows were glazed with thin flakes of mica
        (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">lapis specularis</span></span>), a transparent
        stone brought from Spain and Cappadocia, but in the country this
        costly luxury was dispensed with, as the villas were occupied only in
        the heat of summer, when there was no need to exclude the air. The
        window openings were closed with shutters. Rooms were not warmed by
        fireplaces, with wood fires on hearths, but by an arrangement beneath
        the mosaic and cement floor, where a furnace was kindled, and the
        smoke and heated air were carried by numerous pipes up the walls on
        all sides, thus producing a summer heat within when all was winter
        without.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the fever of
        her mind, Perpetua neither felt <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page207">[pg 207]</span><a name="Pg207" id="Pg207" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>the asperity of the weather nor noticed the
        comfort of the heated rooms. She was incessantly restless, was ever
        running to the window or the door, as often to be disappointed, in
        anticipation of meeting her mother. She was perplexed as to the
        purpose for which she had been conveyed to Ad Fines. The slave woman,
        Blanda, who attended her, was unable or unwilling to give her
        information. All she pretended to know was that orders had been
        issued by Callipodius, friend and client of Æmilius Lentulus, her
        master, that the young lady was to be made comfortable, was to be
        supplied with whatever she required, and was on no account to be
        suffered to leave the grounds. The family was strictly enjoined not
        to mention to any one her presence in the villa, under pain of severe
        chastisement.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Blanda was kind
        and considerate, and had less of the fawning dog in her manner than
        was customary among slaves. It was never possible, even for masters,
        to trust the word of their servants; consequently Perpetua, who knew
        what slaves were, placed little reliance on the asseverations of
        ignorance that fell from the lips of Blanda. There was, in the
        conversation of Blanda, that which the woman intended to reassure,
        but which actually heightened <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page208">[pg 208]</span><a name="Pg208" id="Pg208" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>the uneasiness of the girl—this was the way in
        which the woman harped continually on the good looks, amiability and
        wealth of her master, who, as she insisted, belonged to the Voltinian
        tribe, and was therefore one of the best connected and highest placed
        in the colony.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The knowledge that
        she had been removed to Ad Fines to insure her safety did not satisfy
        Perpetua; and she was by no means assured that she had thus been
        carried off with the approbation and knowledge of her mother, or of
        the bishop and principal Christians of her acquaintance in Nemausus.
        Of Æmilius Varo she really knew nothing save that he was a man of
        pleasure and a lawyer.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Adjoining the
        house was a conservatory. Citron trees and oleanders in large
        green-painted boxes were employed in summer to decorate the terrace
        and gardens. They were allowed to be out in mild winters, but
        directly the mistral began to howl, the men-servants of the house had
        hurriedly conveyed them within doors into the conservatory, as the
        gale would strip them of their fruit, bruise the leaves and injure
        the flowers.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In her trouble of
        mind, unable to go abroad in the bitter weather, impatient of quiet,
        Perpetua <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page209">[pg
        209]</span><a name="Pg209" id="Pg209" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>entered the citron-house and walked among the
        trees in their green tubs, now praying for help, then wiping the
        drops from her eyes and brow.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As she thus paced,
        she heard a stir in the house, the opening of doors, the rush of wind
        driving through it, the banging of valves and rattle of shutters.
        Then she heard voices, and among them one that was imperious. A
        moment later, Blanda ran to Perpetua, and after making a low
        obeisance said: <span class="tei tei-q">“The master is come. He
        desires permission to speak with you, lady, when he hath had his bath
        and hath assumed a change of raiment. For by the mother goddesses, no
        one can be many moments without and not be drenched to the bone. And
        this exhibits the master’s regard for thee, lady; his extreme
        devotion to your person and regard for your comfort, that he has
        exposed himself to cold and rain and wind so as to come hither to
        inquire if you are well, and if there be aught you desire that he can
        perform to content you.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">What was Perpetua
        to do? She plucked some citron blossoms in her nervous agitation,
        unknowing what she did, then answered timidly: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I am in the house of the noble Æmilius. Let him speak
        with me here when it suits his convenience. Yet stay, <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page210">[pg 210]</span><a name="Pg210" id="Pg210"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Blanda! Inquire at once, whether he brings
        me tidings of my dear mother.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The slave hasted
        away, and returned directly to inform Perpetua that her master was
        grieved to relate that he was unable to give her the desired
        information, but that he only awaited instructions from Perpetua to
        take measures to satisfy her.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then the girl was
        left alone, and in greater agitation than before. She walked among
        the evergreens, putting the citron flowers to her nose, plucking off
        the leaves, pressing her hand to her brow, and wiping her distilling
        eyes.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The conservatory
        was unglazed. It was furnished with shutters in which were small
        openings like those in fiddles. Consequently a twilight reigned in
        the place; what light entered was colorless, and without brilliancy.
        Through the openings could be seen the whirling vapors; through them
        also the rain spluttered in, and the wind sighed a plaintive strain,
        now and then rising to a scream.</p>

        held the little bunch of citron in her hand; she was as unaware that
        she held it as that she had plucked it. Her mind was otherwise
        engaged, and her nervous fingers must needs clasp
        something.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page211">[pg

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As she thus
        walked, fearing the appearance of Æmilius, and yet desirous of having
        a term put to her suspense, she heard steps, and in another moment
        the young lawyer stood before her. He bowed with hands extended, and
        with courtly consideration would not draw near. Aware that she was
        shy or frightened, he said: <span class="tei tei-q">“I have to ask
        your pardon, young lady, for this intrusion on your privacy, above
        all for your abduction to this house of mine. It was done without my
        having been consulted, but was done with good intent, by a friend, to
        place you out of danger. I had no part in the matter; nevertheless I
        rejoice that my house has had the honor of serving you as a refuge
        from such as seek your destruction.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I thank you,”</span> answered the girl constrainedly.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“I owe you a word of acknowledgment of my
        lively gratitude for having rescued me from the fountain, and another
        for affording me shelter here. But if I may be allowed to ask a
        favor, it is that my mother be restored to me, or me to my
        mother.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        "tei tei-q">“I have no knowledge where she is. I myself have been in
        concealment—for the rabble has been incensed against me for what I
        was privileged to do, at the Nemausean <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        ventured into the town; not that I believe the rabble would dare
        attempt violence against me, but I do not think it wise to allow them
        the chance. I sent my good, blundering friend Callipodius to inquire
        what had become of you, as I was anxious lest you should again be in
        peril of your life; and he—Callipodius—seeing what a ferment there
        was in the town, and how determined the priesthood was to get you
        once more into its power, he consulted his mother wit, and had you
        conveyed to my country house. Believe me, lady, he was actuated by a
        sincere wish to do you service. If he had but taken the Lady Quincta
        away as well, and lodged her here along with you, I would not have a
        word of reproach for him, nor entertain a feeling of guilt in your
        eyes.”</span></p>

        into Perpetua’s eyes. She looked at the young man, who stood before
        her with such dignity and gentleness of demeanor. He seemed to her to
        be as noble, as good as a heathen well could be. He felt for her
        delicate position; he had risked his life and fortunes to save her.
        He had roused the powerful religious faction of his native city
        against him, and he was now extending his protection over her against
        the priesthood and the mob of Nemausus.</p>

        hurry on the rites which shall make us one, and not a tongue can stir

        The sacrifice has been illegal all along, but winked at by the
        magistrates because a custom handed down with the sanction of
        antiquity. But a resolute protest made—if need be an appeal to
        Cæsar—and the priesthood are paralyzed. Consider also that as my wife
        they could no longer demand you. Their hold on you would be done for,

        from Arelate sent over to contend in boats against a fleet of our

        have been wolves trapped during the winter in the Cebennæ, and sent
        down here, where they are retained fasting. I have heard their howls
        at night and they have disturbed my sleep—their howls and the aches
        in my thigh. I knew the weather would change by the pains in my
        joint. There is a man named Amphilochius, a manumitted slave, who
        broke into and robbed the villa of the master who had freed him. He
        is a Greek of Iconium, and the public are promised that he shall be
        cast to the beasts; but whether to the panthers, or the wolves, or
        bear, or given to be gored by a bull, that I know not. Then there is
        a taverner from somewhere on the way to Ugernum, who for years has
        murdered such of his guests as he esteemed well furnished with money,
        and has thrown their carcasses into the river. He will fight the
        beasts. There is a bear from Larsacus; but they tell me he is dull,
        has not yet shaken off his winter sleep, and the people fear they
        will get small entertainment out of him.”</span></p>

        little danger to life or limb, and it taught them to be quick of eye
        and nimble in movement. But it was because none were gored that the
        spectators wearied of these innocent sports and clamored for the
        butchery of criminals and the contests of gladiators. There was a

        advice <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page222">[pg 222]</span><a name=
        "Pg222" id="Pg222" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>as to my future
        conduct, and where I shall bestow myself.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“He has remained unmolested,”</span> said the slave,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“and that is to me passing strange, for I
        have been told that certain of the brethren, when questioned relative
        to the mutilation of the statue, have accused him by name. Yet, so
        far, nothing has been done. Yet I think his house is watched; I have
        noticed one Burrhus hanging about it; and Tarsius, they say, has
        turned informer. See, master! the darkness is passing away; already
        there is a wan light in the east.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Had the mouth of the kiln been turned to the setting in
        place of the rising sun, we should not have felt the wind so greatly.
        Well, Pedo, we will be on the move. Market people from the country
        will be at the gates. I will consult with Marcianus before I do
        aught.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">An hour later,
        Baudillas and his attendant were at the gate of Augustus, and passed
        in unchallenged. Owing to the furious mistral, accompanied by driving
        rain, the guards muffled themselves in their cloaks and paid little
        attention to the peasants bringing in their poultry, fish and
        vegetables for sale. The deacon and his slave entered unnoticed along
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page223">[pg 223]</span><a name="Pg223"
        id="Pg223" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>with a party of these. In the
        street leading to the forum was a knot of people about an angry
        potter whose stall had been blown over by the wind. He had set boards
        on trestles, and laid out basins, pitchers, lamps, urns on the
        planks; over all he had stretched sail-cloth. The wind had caught the
        awning and beaten it down, upsetting and crushing his ware. The
        potter was swearing that he was ruined, and that his disaster was due
        to the Christians, who had exasperated the gods by their crimes and
        impieties.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Some looking on
        laughed and asked, shouting, whether the gods did not blow as strong
        blasts out of their lungs every year about the same time, and whether
        they did so because annually insulted.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“But they don’t break my crocks,”</span> stormed the
        potter.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Charge double for what remain unfractured,”</span> joked
        an onlooker.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Come, master,”</span> said Pedo, plucking Baudillas by
        the sleeve. <span class="tei tei-q">“If that angry fellow recognize
        you, you are lost. Hold my cloak and turn down the lane, then we are
        at the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=

        back of the house. I know some of the family, and they will admit
        us.”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page224">[pg

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Near by was a shop
        for flowers. Over the shop front was the inscription, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Non vendo nisi amantibus coronas”</span> (<span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I sell garlands to lovers only”</span>).<a id=

        woman in charge of the bunches and crowns of spring flowers looked
        questioningly at Baudillas. Her wares were such as invited only when
        the sun shone. The poor flowers had a draggled and desponding
        appearance. No lovers came to buy in the bitter mistral.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        Pedo.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In another moment
        they had passed out of the huffle of the wind and the drift of the
        rain into the shelter and warmth of a dwelling.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Pedo bade a slave
        go to Marcianus and tell the deacon that someone below desired a word
        with him. Almost immediately the man returned with orders to conduct
        the visitor to the presence of the master.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Baudillas was led
        along a narrow passage into a chamber in the inner part of the house,
        away from the apartments for the reception of guests.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The room was
        warmed. It was small, and had a glazed window; that is to say, the
        opening was closed <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page225">[pg
        225]</span><a name="Pg225" id="Pg225" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>by a
        sheet of stalagmite from one of the caves of Larsacus, cut thin.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this chamber,
        seated on an easy couch, with a roll in his hand, which he was
        studying, was Marcianus. His countenance was hard and haughty.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“You!”</span> he exclaimed, starting with surprise.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“What brings you here? I heard that you had
        been before the magistrate and had confessed. But, bah! of such as
        you martyrs are not made. You have betrayed us and got off clear
        yourself.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“You mistake, brother,”</span> answered Baudillas,
        modestly. <span class="tei tei-q">“In one thing are you right—I am
        not of the stuff out of which martyrs and confessors are fashioned.
        But I betrayed no one. Not that there is any merit due to me for
        that. I was in such a dire and paralyzing fright that I could not
        speak.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“How then come you here?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“As we read that the Lord sent His angel to deliver Peter
        from prison, so has it been with me.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“You lie!”</span> said Marcianus angrily. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“No miracle was wrought for you—for such as you who
        shiver and quake and lose power of speech! Bah! Come, give me a more
        rational explanation of your escape.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        tail and used your legs. I can well believe it. Coward! Unworthy of
        the name of a Christian, undeserving of the cross marked on thy brow,

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        Thou wast called to a glorious confession, and looked back and ran

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Marcianus rose and
        strode up and down the room, biting his nails. Then, contemptuously,
        he said: <span class="tei tei-q">“My family will stand between me and
        mob or magistrate. I fear not. But get thee gone. Thou compromisest
        me by thy presence, thou runagate and jail-breaker.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Baudillas left;
        and, as he went from the door, Pedo whispered in his ear:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Let us escape to Ad Fines. We can do so in
        this detestable weather. I have an old friend there, named Blanda. In

        us.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He suddenly
        checked himself, plucked the deacon back, and drew him against the
        wall.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">An ædile, attended
        by a body of the city police, armed like soldiers, advanced and

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Quatuorvir
        Petronius Atacinus, who was on duty, occupied his chair in the
        stately Plotinian Basilica, or court of justice, that had been
        erected by Hadrian, in honor of the lady to whose ingenious and
        unscrupulous maneuvers he owed his elevation to the throne of the
        Cæsars. Of this magnificent structure nothing remains at present save
        some scraps of the frieze in the museum.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the weather
        permitted, Petronius or his colleagues liked to hear a case in the
        open air, from a tribune in the forum. But this was impossible
        to-day, in the howling wind and lashing rain. The court itself was
        comparatively deserted. A very few had assembled to hear the trials.
        None who had a warmed home that day left it uncalled for. Some market
        women set their baskets in the doorway and stepped inside, but it was
        rather because they were wet and out of breath than because they were
        interested in the proceedings. Beside the magistrate sat the chief
        <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=

        city, but one of these was a woman, the priestess of Nemausus.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Throughout the
        south of Gaul the worship of Augustus had become predominant, and had
        displaced most of the ancestral cults. The temples dedicated to
        Augustus exceeded in richness all others, and were crowded when the
        rest were deserted.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Jupiter was only
        not forgotten because he had borrowed some of the attributes of the
        Gallic solar deity, and he flourished the golden wheel in one hand
        and brandished the lightnings in the other. Juno had lent her name to
        a whole series of familiar spirits of the mountains and of the
        household, closely allied to the <span lang="la" class=
        "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Proxumes</span></span>, a set of domestic
        Brownies or Kobolds, who were chiefly adored and propitiated by the
        women, and who had no other temple than the hearth. At Tarasconum,
        the Phœnician goddess Britomartis reigned supreme, and her worship
        was stimulated by a grand annual procession and dramatic
        representation of her conquest over a dragon. At Nemausus the
        corresponding god of war was called Mars Britovius. But the Volcæ
        Arecomici were a peaceably-disposed people, and paid little devotion
        to the god of battles. The cult <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page232">[pg 232]</span><a name="Pg232" id="Pg232" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>of the founder Nemausus did not flag, but that
        of Augustus was in the ascendant. All the freedmen were united in one
        great sodality under his invocation, and this guild represented an
        important political factor in the land. It had its religious
        officers, its <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
        "la"><span style="font-style: italic">flamines</span></span> and
        <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">seviri</span></span>, attended by lictors, and
        the latter had charge of all the altars at the crossroads, and sat
        next to the civic functionaries in the courts, at banquets, in the
        theater. Rich citizens bequeathed large sums to the town and to the
        sodalities to be expended in public feasts, in largesses, and in
        gladiatorial shows. The charge of these bequests, as also their
        distribution, was in the hands of the <span lang="la" class=

        therefore, provided with the most powerful of all means for gaining
        and moving the multitude, which desired nothing better than bread and
        games.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <span class="tei tei-q">“It bangs in this evil wind, and I cannot
        even hear what my excellent friend Lucius Smerius is saying in my
        ear; how then can I catch what is said in court?”</span> Then,
        turning to the pontiff, he said: <span class="tei tei-q">“I detest
        this weather. Last year, about this time, I was struck with an evil
        blast, and lost all sense of smell and taste for nine months. I had
        pains in <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page233">[pg
        233]</span><a name="Pg233" id="Pg233" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>my
        loins and an ache in all my bones. I doubt if even the jests of Baubo
        could have made me laugh; I was in lower dumps than even Ceres. Even
        now, when seated far too long in this marble chair, I get an ache
        across my back that assures me I am no longer young. But I could
        endure that if my sense of taste had been fully restored. I do not
        relish good wine as of old, and that is piteous, and I really at
        times think of suicide.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        Bona Dea you would find—what? No more than did Clodius—nothing at

        Proxumes, Victoria Augusta, Venus, and Minerva, make room for her
        without even a frown on their divine faces. And imperial Rome
        sanctions all these devotions. Why, did not the god Augustus build a
        temple here to Nemausus and pay him divine honors, though he had
        never heard him named before? Now this Christian sect is exclusive.
        It will suffer no gods to stand beside Him whom they adore. He must
        reign alone. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page235">[pg

        and will oppose your nomination to the knighthood. They have joined
        hands with the Cultores Nemausi, and insist that proper retribution
        be administered to the transgressors, and that the girl be

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The magistrate

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The deacon was

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        committed the sacrilegious act of defacing the statue. What answer
        make you to this?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Marcianus replied

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        "tei tei-q">“I cannot hear thee, the wind blusters and bellows so
        loud.”</span> Aside to the pontiff Smerius he added: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And ever since that evil blast you wot of, I have
        suffered from a singing in my ears.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I did it,”</span> said the deacon. Again he looked about

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Then,”</span> said the magistrate, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“we shall at once conclude this matter. The outrage is
        too gross to be condoned or lightly punished. Even thy friends and
        kinsfolk have not appeared to speak for thee. Thy family has been one
        of dignity and authority in Nemausus. There have been members who
        have been clothed with the Quatuorvirate <span lang="la" class=

        sentence Cneius Falerius Marcianus, son of Marius Audolatius, of the
        Voltinian tribe, to be thrown to the beasts in the approaching show,
        and that his goods be confiscated, and that out of his property
        restitution be made, by which a new statue to the god Nemausus be
        provided, to be set up in the place of that injured by the same
        Cneius Falerius Marcianus.”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The deacon made an
        attempt to speak. He seemed overwhelmed with astonishment and dismay
        at the sentence, so utterly unexpected in its severity. He
        gesticulated and cried out, but the Quatuorvir was cold and weary. He
        had pronounced a sentence that would startle all the town, and he
        thought he had done enough.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Remove him at once,”</span> said he.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then Petronius
        turned to the pontiff and said: <span class="tei tei-q">“Now, my
        Smerius, what say you to this? Will not this content you and all the
        noisy rag-tag at your back?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Next he commanded
        the rest of the prisoners to be brought forward together. This was a
        mixed number of poor persons, some women, some old men, boys, slaves
        and freedmen; none belonged to the upper class or even to that of the
        manufacturers and tradesmen.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“You are all dismissed,”</span> said the magistrate.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“The imprisonment you have undergone will
        serve as a warning to you not to associate with image-breakers, not
        to enter into sodalities which have not received the sanction of
        Cæsar, and which are not compatible with the well-being and quiet of
        the city and are an element of disturbance in the empire. Let

        Christos.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then the lictors
        gathered around the Quatuorvir and the pontiff, who also rose, and
        extended his hand to assist the magistrate, who made wry faces as
        rheumatic twinges nipped his back.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Come with me, Smerius,”</span> said the Quatuorvir,

        power. I hate unnecessary harshness. But this fellow, Falerius
        Marcianus, has deserved the worst. If the old woman be put on the
        rack and squeak out, and Marcianus be devoured by beasts, the people
        will have their amusement, and none can say that I have acted with
        excessive rigor—and, my dear man—not a word has been said about
        Christianity. The cases have been tried on other counts, do you
        see?”</span> he winked. <span class="tei tei-q">“Will you breakfast

        lashes I received. I could not collect May-dew, for the sky was
        overcast and the herb was dry. But she regarded not my excuse.
        Tullia, my fellow-slave, was more sly. She filled a flask at a spring
        and pretended that she <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page248">[pg

        sobbing, and my tears fell on the arid grass. He came to me, moved by

        the use of simples. My mistress found no advantage from the
        spring-water brought her as May-dew. Then I offered her some of the

        "font-size: 100%">THE ARENA</span></span></h1>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The games that
        were to be given in the amphitheater of Nemausus on the nones of
        March were due to a bequest of Domitius Afer, the celebrated, or
        rather infamous, informer and rhetorician, who had brought so many
        citizens of Rome to death during the principate of Tiberius. He had
        run great risk himself under Caligula, but had escaped by a piece of
        adroit flattery. In dying he bequeathed a large sum out of his
        ill-gotten gains—the plunder of those whom he had destroyed, and
        whose families he had ruined—to be expended in games in the
        amphitheater on the nones of March, for the delectation of the
        citizens, and to keep his memory green in his native city.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The games were to
        last two days. On the first there would be contests with beasts, and
        on the second a water combat, when the arena would be flooded and
        converted into a lake.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Great anxiety was
        entertained relative to the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page257">[pg
        257]</span><a name="Pg257" id="Pg257" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>weather. Unless the mistral ceased and the rain
        passed away, it would be impossible for the sports to be held. It was
        true that the entire oval could be covered in by curtains and mats,
        stretched between poles, but this contrivance was intended as shelter
        against sun and not rain. Moreover, the violence of the wind had
        rendered it quite impossible to extend the curtains.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The town was in
        the liveliest excitement. The man guilty of having mutilated the
        statue had been sentenced to be cast to the beasts, and this man was
        no vulgar criminal out of the slums, but belonged to one of the
        superior <span class="tei tei-q">“orders.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That a great
        social change had taken place in the province, and that the freedmen
        had stepped into power and influence, to the displacement of their
        former masters, was felt by the descendants of the first Ægypto-Greek
        colonists, and by the relics of the Gaulish nobility, but they hardly
        endured to admit the fact in words. The exercise of the rights of
        citizenship, the election of the officials, the qualification for
        filling the superior secular and religious offices, belonged to the
        decurion or noble families. Almost the sole office open to those
        below was that of the seviri; and yet even in elections the
        freed<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page258">[pg 258]</span><a name=
        "Pg258" id="Pg258" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>men were beginning to
        exhibit a power of control.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now, one of the
        old municipal families was to be humbled by a member being subjected
        to the degradation of death in the arena, and none of the Falerii
        ventured to raise a voice in his defence, so critical did they
        perceive the situation to be. The sodality of the Augustals in
        conclave had determined that an example was to be made of Marcianus,
        and had made this plain to the magistrates. They had even insisted on
        the manner of his execution. His death would be a plain announcement
        to the decurion class that its domination was at an end. The ancient
        patrician and plebeian families of Rome had been extinguished in
        blood, and their places filled by a new nobility of army factors and
        money-lenders. A similar revolution had taken place in the provinces
        by less bloody means. There, the transfer of power was due largely to
        the favor of the prince accorded to the freedmen.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the Augustal
        colleges everywhere, the Cæsar had a body of devoted adherents, men
        without nationality, with no historic position, no traditions of past
        independence; men, moreover, who were shrewd enough to see that by
        combination they <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page259">[pg
        259]</span><a name="Pg259" id="Pg259" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>would eventually be able to wrest the control of
        the municipal government from those who had hitherto exercised
        it.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The rumor spread
        rapidly that a fresh entertainment was to be provided. The damsel who
        had been rescued from the basin of Nemausus had surrendered herself
        in order to obtain the release of her mother; and the magistrate in
        office, Petronius Atacinus, out of consideration for the good people
        of the town, whom he loved, and out of reverence for the gods who had
        been slighted, had determined that she should be produced in the
        arena, and there obliged publicly to sacrifice, and then to be
        received into the priesthood. Should she, however, prove obdurate,
        then she would be tortured into compliance.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nor was this all.
        Baudillas Macer, the last scion of a decayed Volcian family, who had
        been cast into the pit of the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign"
        xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">robur</span></span>,
        but had escaped, was also to be brought out and executed, as having
        assisted in the rescue of Perpetua from the fountain, but chiefly for
        having connived at the crime of Falerius Marcianus.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To the general
        satisfaction, the wind fell as suddenly as it had risen, and that on
        the night preceding <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page260">[pg
        260]</span><a name="Pg260" id="Pg260" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the
        sports. The weather remained bitterly cold, and the sky was dark with
        clouds that seemed ready to burst. Not a ray of sunlight traveled
        across the arena and climbed the stages of the amphitheater. The day
        might have been one in November, and the weather that encountered on
        the northern plains of Germania.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The townsfolk, and
        the spectators from the country, came provided against the
        intemperance of the weather, wrapped in their warmest mantles, which
        they drew as hoods over their heads. Slaves arrived, carrying boxes
        with perforated tops, that contained glowing charcoal, so that their
        masters and mistresses might keep their feet warm whilst attending
        the games. Some carried cushions for the seats, others wolf-skin rugs
        to throw over the knees of the well-to-do spectators.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The ranges of the
        great oval were for the most part packed with spectators. The topmost
        seats were full long before the rest. The stone benches were divided
        into tiers. At the bottom, near the <span lang="la" class=
        "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">podium</span></span> or breastwork confining the
        arena, were those for the municipal dignitaries, for the priests, and
        for certain strangers to whom seats had been granted by decree of the
        town council. Here might be read, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page261">[pg 261]</span><a name="Pg261" id="Pg261" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-q">“Forty seats decreed to
        the navigators of the Rhône and Saone;”</span> at another part of the
        circumference, <span class="tei tei-q">“Twenty-five places appointed
        to the navigators of the Ardèche and the Ouvèze.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Above the ranges
        of seats set apart for the officials and guests were those belonging
        to the decurions and knights, the nobility and gentry of the town and
        little republic. The third range was that allotted to the freedmen
        and common townsfolk and peasants from the country, and the topmost
        stage was abandoned to be occupied by slaves alone. At one end of the
        ellipse sat the principal magistrates close to the <span lang="la"
        class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">podium</span></span> at one end, and at the
        other the master of the games and his attendants, the prefect of the
        watch and of the firemen.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Two doors, one at
        each end, gave access to the arena, or means of exit. One was that of
        the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
        "la"><span style="font-style: italic">vivarium</span></span>, whence
        the gladiators and prisoners issued from a large chamber under the
        seats and feet of the spectators. The other door was that which
        conducted to the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
        "la"><span style="font-style: italic">libitinum</span></span>, into
        which were cast the corpses of men and the carcasses of beasts that
        had perished in the games.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Immediately below
        the seat of the principal magistrates and of the pontiffs was a
        little altar, on <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page262">[pg
        262]</span><a name="Pg262" id="Pg262" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the
        breastwork about the arena, with a statue of Nemausus above it; and a
        priest stood at the side to keep the charcoal alight, and to serve
        the incense to such as desired to do homage to the god.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was remarked
        that the attendance in the reserved seats of the decurions was
        meager. Such as were connected with the Falerian family by blood or
        marriage made it a point to absent themselves; others stayed away
        because huffed at the insolence of the freedmen, and considering that
        the sentence passed on Marcianus was a slight cast on their
        order.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the other hand,
        the freedmen crowded to the show in full force, and not having room
        to accommodate themselves and their families in the zone allotted to
        them, some audaciously threw themselves over the barriers of
        demarcation and were followed by others, and speedily flooded the
        benches of the decurions.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the
        magistrates arrived, preceded by their lictors, all in the
        amphitheater rose, and the Quatuor-viri bowed to the public. Each
        took a pinch from the priest, who extended a silver shell containing
        aromatic gums, and cast it on the fire, some gravely, Petronius with
        a flippant gesture. Then <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page263">[pg
        263]</span><a name="Pg263" id="Pg263" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the
        latter turned to the Augustal <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign"
        xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">flamen</span></span>,
        saying: <span class="tei tei-q">“To the god Augustus and the divine
        Julia (Livia),”</span> and he threw some more grains on the
        charcoal.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Body of Bacchus!”</span> said he, as he took his seat,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“a little fizzling spark such as that may
        please the gods, but does not content me. I wish I had a roaring fire
        at which, like a babe out of its bath, I could spread my ten toes and
        as many fingers. Such a day as this is! With cold weather I cannot
        digest my food properly. I feel a lump in me as did Saturn when his
        good Rhea gave him a meal of stones. I am full of twinges. By Vulcan
        and his bellows! if it had not been for duty I would have been at
        home adoring the Lares and Penates. These shows are for the young and
        warm-blooded. The arms of my chair send a chill into my marrow-bones.
        What comes first? Oh! a contest with a bull. Well, I shall curl up
        and doze like a marmot. Wake me, good Smerius, when the next portion
        of the entertainment begins.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A bull was
        introduced, and a gladiator was employed to exasperate and play with
        the beast. He waved a garment before its eyes, then drove a sharp
        instrument into its flank, and when the beast turned, he nimbly
        leaped out of the way. When <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page264">[pg
        264]</span><a name="Pg264" id="Pg264" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>pursued he ran, then turned sharply, put his
        hands on the back of the bull, and leaped over it.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The people
        cheered, but they had seen the performance so often repeated that
        they speedily tired of such poor sport. The bull was accordingly
        dispatched. Horses were introduced and hooked to the carcass, which
        was rapidly drawn out. Then entered attendants of the amphitheater,
        who strewed sand where the blood had been spilt, bowed and
        retired.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thereupon the
        jailer threw open the gates of the <span lang="la" class=
        "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">vivarium</span></span> and brought forth the
        prisoners. These consisted of the taverner who had murdered his
        guests, the manumitted slave who had robbed his master, Baudillas,
        Marcianus and Perpetua.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A thrill of cruel
        delight ran through the concourse of spectators. Now something was
        about to be shown them, harrowing to the feelings, gratifying to the
        ferocity that is natural to all men, and is expelled, not at all by
        civilization, but by divine grace only.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It enhanced the
        pleasure of the spectators that criminals should witness the death of
        their fellows. Eyes scanned their features, observed whether they
        turned sick and faint, whether they winced, or <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page265">[pg 265]</span><a name="Pg265" id="Pg265"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>whether they remained cool and callous.
        This gave a cruel zest to their enjoyment.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A bear was
        produced. Dogs were set on him, and he was worried till he shook off
        his torpor and was worked into fury. Then, at a sign from the manager
        of the games, the dogs were called off, and the man who had murdered
        his guests was driven forward towards the incensed beast.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The fellow was
        sullen, and gave no token of fear. He folded his arms, leaned against
        the marble <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
        "la"><span style="font-style: italic">podium</span></span>, and
        looked contemptuously around him at the occupants of the tiers of
        seats.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The bear, relieved
        from his aggressors, seemed indisposed to notice the man.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then the
        spectators roared to the criminal, bidding him invite the brute
        against himself. It was a strange fact that often in these horrible
        exhibitions a man condemned to fight with the beasts allowed himself
        a brief display of vanity, and sought to elicit the applause of the
        spectators by his daring conduct to the animal that was to mangle and
        kill him.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the
        ill-humored fellow would not give this pleasure to the onlookers.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then the master of
        the sports signed to the attend<span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page266">[pg 266]</span><a name="Pg266" id="Pg266" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>ants to goad the bear. They obeyed, and he
        turned and growled and struck at them, but would not touch the man
        designed to be hugged by him.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After many vain
        attempts, amidst the hooting and roar of the people, a sign was made.
        Some gladiators leaped in, and with their swords dispatched the
        taverner.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The spectators
        were indignant. They had been shown no sport, only a common
        execution. They were shivering with cold; some grumbled, and said
        that this was childish stuff to witness which was not worth the
        discomfort of the exposure. Then, as with one voice, rose the yell:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“The wolves! send in the wolves! Marcianus to
        the wolves!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The master of the
        games dispatched a messenger to the Quatuorvir who was then the
        acting magistrate. He nodded to what was said, waved his hand in the
        direction of the master’s box, and the latter sent an attendant to
        the keeper of the beasts.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
        jailer-executioner at once grasped the deacon Falerius Marcianus by
        the shoulders, bade him descend some steps and enter the arena.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Marcianus was
        deadly white. He shrank with disgust from the spot where the soil was
        drenched with the blood of the taverner, and which was not
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page267">[pg 267]</span><a name="Pg267"
        id="Pg267" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>as yet strewn over with fresh
        sand. He cast a furtive look at the altar, then made an appealing
        gesture to the magistrate.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Come here, Cneius Marcianus,”</span> said Petronius.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“You belong to a respectable and ancient
        family. You have been guilty of an infamous deed that has brought
        disgrace on your entire order. See how many absent themselves this
        day on that account! Your property is confiscated, you are sentenced
        to death. Yet I give you one chance. Sacrifice to the gods and
        blaspheme Christ. I do not promise you life if you do this. You must
        appeal to the people. If they see you offer incense, they will know
        that you have renounced the Crucified. Then I will put the question
        to their decision. If they hold up their thumbs you will live.
        Consider, it is a chance; it depends, not on me, but on their humor.
        Will you sacrifice?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Marcianus looked
        at the mighty hoop of faces. He saw that the vast concourse was
        thrilled with expectation; a notion crossed the mind of one of the
        freedmen that Marcianus was being given a means of escape, and he
        shouted words that, though audible and intelligible to those near,
        were not to be caught by such as were distant. But the purport of his
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page268">[pg 268]</span><a name="Pg268"
        id="Pg268" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>address was understood, and
        produced a deafening, a furious roar of remonstrance.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I will not sacrifice,”</span> said the deacon;
        <span class="tei tei-q">“I am a Christian.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then Petronius
        Atacinus raised his hand, partly to assure the spectators that he was
        not opposing their wishes, partly as a signal to the master of the
        games.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Instantly a low
        door in the barrier was opened, and forth rushed a howling pack of
        wolves. When they had reached the center of the arena, they stood for
        a moment snuffing, and looked about them in questioning attitudes.
        Some, separating from the rest, ran with their snouts against the
        ground to where the recent blood had been spilt. But, all at once, a
        huge gray wolf, that led the pack, uttered a howl, and made a rush
        and a leap towards Marcianus; and the rest followed.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The sight was too
        terrible for the deacon to contemplate it unmoved. He remained but
        for an instant as one frozen, and then with a cry he started and ran
        round the ellipse, and the whole gray pack tore after him. Now and
        then, finding that they gained on him, he turned with threatening
        gestures that cowed the brutes; but this was for a moment
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page269">[pg 269]</span><a name="Pg269"
        id="Pg269" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>only. Their red eyes, their
        gleaming teeth filled the wretched man with fresh terror, and again
        he ran.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The spectators
        clapped their hands—some stood up on their seats and laughed in
        ecstasy of enjoyment. Once, twice he made the circuit of the arena;
        and his pace, if possible, became quicker. The delight of the
        spectators became an intoxication. It was exquisite. Fear in the
        flying man became frantic. His breath, his strength were failing.
        Then suddenly he halted, half turned, and ran to the foot of the
        barrier before the seat of the Quatuor-viri, and extended his hand:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Give me the incense! I worship Nemausus! I
        adore Augustus! I renounce Christ!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the same moment
        the old monster wolf had seized him from behind. The arms of the
        deacon were seen for an instant in the air. The spectators stamped
        and danced and cheered—the dense gray mass of writhing, snarling
        beasts closed over the spot where Marcianus had fallen!</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The acting
        magistrate turned to his fellow-quatuorvir, charged with co-ordinate
        judicial authority, on the left, and said: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Your nose is leaden-purple in hue.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <span class="tei tei-q">“I believe that here in the south we are more
        sensible to frost than are those who live under hyperborean skies.
        There they expect cold, and take precautions accordingly. Here the
        blasts fall on us unawares. We groan and sigh till the sun shines
        out, and then forget our sufferings. Who but fools would be here
        to-day? Look above. The clouds hang low, and are so dark that we may
        expect to be pelted with hail.”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page271">[pg 271]</span><a name="Pg271" id="Pg271" class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Aye,”</span> laughed Petronius, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“as big as the pebbles that strew the Crau wherewith
        Hercules routed the Ligurians. Well; it is black as an eclipse. I
        will give thee a hint, Vibius mine! I have made my slave line this
        marble seat with hot bricks. They are comforting to the spine, the
        very column of life. Presently he will be here with another supply.
        You see we are not all fools. Some do make provision against the
        cold.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I wish I had thought of this before.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“That is precisely the wish that crossed the mind of the
        poor wretch whom the wolves have finished. He postponed his
        renunciation of Christ till just too late.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then Lucius
        Petronius yawned, stretched himself, and signed that the freedman who
        had robbed the master who had manumitted him, should be delivered to
        a panther.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The wolves were
        with difficulty chased out of the arena, and then all was prepared
        for this next exhibition. It was brief. The beast was hungry, and the
        criminal exposed made little effort to resist. Next came the turn of
        Baudillas.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Without raising
        himself in his seat, the Quatuorvir said languidly: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“You broke out of prison, you <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page272">[pg 272]</span><a name="Pg272" id="Pg272" class=

        You refused to sacrifice to the genius of the Emperor. Well, if you
        will cast a few grains of incense in the fire, I will let you
        depart.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I cannot forswear Christ,”</span> said Baudillas with a
        firmness that surprised none so much as himself. But, indeed, the
        fall of Marcianus, so far from drawing him along into the same
        apostasy, had caused a recoil in his soul. To hear his
        fellow-ministrant deny Christ, to see him extend his hands for the
        incense—that inspired him with an indignation which gave immense
        force to his resolution. The Church had been dishonored, the ministry
        disgraced in Marcianus. Oh, that they might not be thus humbled in
        himself!</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <span class="tei tei-q">“take advice, and be speedy in making your

        wolves, hesitated a moment too long, and so lost his life. By the

        "tei tei-q">“Then lead him away. The sword!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The deacon bowed.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“I am unworthy of shedding my blood for
        Christ,”</span> he said, and his voice, though low, was firm.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then he looked
        around and saw the Bishop Castor in the zone allotted to the citizens
        and knights. Baudillas crossed his arms on his breast and knelt on
        the sand, and the bishop, rising from his seat, extended his hand in
        benediction.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He, Castor, had
        not been called to sacrifice. He had not courted death, but he had
        not shrunk from it. He had not concealed himself, nevertheless he had
        been passed over.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then the deacon,
        with firm step, walked into the center of the arena and knelt
        down.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page274">[pg

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In another moment
        his head was severed from the body.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The attendants
        immediately removed every trace of the execution, and now arrived the
        moment for which all had looked with impatience.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The magistrate
        said: <span class="tei tei-q">“Bring forward Perpetua, daughter of

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At once Æmilius

        in which your forensic eloquence can be heard, neither is this a case
        to be adjudicated upon, and calling for defence. The virgin was
        chosen by lot to be given to the god Nemausus, and was again demanded
        by him speaking at midnight, after she had been rescued from his
        fountain, if I mistake not, by you. Your power of interference ceased

        that she enter into his service and be a priestess at his shrine,
        that she pour libations before his altar, and strew rose leaves on
        his fountain. Think you that the Cæsar will interfere in such a
        matter? Think you that, were it to come before him, he would forbid
        this? But ask thy client if the appeal be according to her
        desire.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Perpetua shook her

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Sir,”</span> said Æmilius in great agitation,

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        fellow-magistrate, and said, laughing, <span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Fuscianus shrugged
        his shoulders. <span class="tei tei-q">“I hate all meddlers with

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The populace
        became impatient, shouted and stamped. Some, provided with empty
        gourds, in which were pebbles, rattled them, and made a strange sound
        as of a hailstorm. Others clacked together pieces of pottery. The
        magistrate turned to the pontiff on his right and said: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“We believe with all our hearts in the gods when we do
        sacrifice! Oh, mightily, I trow.”</span> Then he laughed again. The
        priest looked grave for a moment, and then he laughed also.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Come now,”</span> said Lucius Petronius to the young
        lawyer, <span class="tei tei-q">“to this I limit thy interference.
        Stand by the girl and induce her to yield. By the Bow-bearer! young
        men do not often fail in winning the consent of girls when they use
        their best blandishments. It will be a scene for the stage. You have
        plenty of spectators.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Suffer me also to stand beside her,”</span> said the
        slave-woman Blanda, who had not left Perpetua.</p><span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page277">[pg 277]</span><a name="Pg277" id="Pg277"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“By all means. And if you two succeed, none will be
        better content than myself. I am not one who would wish a fair virgin
        a worse fate than to live and be merry and grow old. Ah me! old
        age!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again the
        multitude shouted and rattled pumpkins.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“We are detaining the people in the cold,”</span> said
        the presiding magistrate; <span class="tei tei-q">“the sports move
        sluggishly as does our blood.”</span> Then, aside to Fuscianus,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“My bricks are becoming sensibly chilled. I
        require a fresh supply.”</span> Then to the maiden: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Hear me, Perpetua, daughter of Harpinius Læto that
        was—we and the gods, or the gods and we, are indisposed to deal
        harshly. Throw a few crumbs of incense on the altar, and you shall
        pass at once up those steps to the row of seats where sit the
        white-robed priestesses with their crowns. I shall be well
        content.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“That is a thing I cannot do,”</span> said Perpetua
        firmly.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Then we shall have to make you,”</span> said the
        magistrate in hard tones. He was angry, vexed. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“You will prove more compliant when you have been
        extended on the rack. Let her be disrobed and
        tortured.”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page278">[pg
        278]</span><a name="Pg278" id="Pg278" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then descended
        into the arena two young men, who bowed to the magistrate, solicited
        leave, and drew forth styles or iron pens and tablets covered with
        wax. These were the scribes of the Church employed everywhere to take
        down a record of the last interrogatory of a martyr. Such records
        were called the <span class="tei tei-q">“Acts.”</span> Of them great
        numbers have been preserved, but unhappily rarely unfalsified. The
        simplicity of the acts, the stiffness of style, the <a name="corr278"
        id="corr278" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class=
        "tei tei-corr">absence</span> of all miraculous incident, did not
        suit the taste of mediæval compilers, and they systematically
        interpolated the earlier acts with harrowing details and records of
        marvels. Nevertheless, a certain number of these acts remain
        uncorrupted, and with regard to the rest it is not difficult to
        separate in them that which is fictitious from that which is genuine.
        Such notaries were admitted to the trials and executions with as much
        indifference as would be newspaper reporters nowadays.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again, with the
        sweat of anguish breaking out on his brow, Æmilius interposed.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I pray your mercy,”</span> he said; <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“let the sentence be still further modified. Suffer the
        damsel to be relieved of becoming a priestess. Let her become my
        wife, and I swear that I will make over my estate <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page279">[pg 279]</span><a name="Pg279" id="Pg279"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of Ad Fines to the temple of the god
        Nemausus, with the villa upon it, and statues and works of
        art.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“That is an offer to be entertained by the priesthood and
        not by me. Boy—hot bricks! and be quick about removing those which
        have become almost cold.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A pause ensued
        whilst the proposal of Æmilius was discussed between the chief
        priestess of the fountain and the Augustal <span lang="la" class=
        "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">flamen</span></span> and the other pontiffs.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The populace
        became restless, impatient, noisy. They shouted, hooted; called out
        that they were tired of seeing nothing.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Come,”</span> said Petronius, <span class="tei tei-q">“I
        cannot further delay proceedings.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“We consent,”</span> said the chief pontiff.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“That is well.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then Æmilius
        approached Perpetua, and entreated her to give way. To cast a few
        grains on the charcoal meant nothing; it was a mere movement of the
        hand, a hardly conscious muscular act, altogether out of comparison
        with the results. Such compliance would give her life, happiness, and
        would place her in a position to do vast good, and <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page280">[pg 280]</span><a name="Pg280" id="Pg280"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>he assured her that his whole life would
        be devoted to her service.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I cannot,”</span> she said, looking Æmilius full in the
        face. <span class="tei tei-q">“Do not think me ungrateful; my heart
        overflows for what you have done for me, but I cannot deny my
        Christ.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again he urged
        her. Let her consent and he—even he would become a Christian.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“No,”</span> said she, <span class="tei tei-q">“not at
        that price. You would be in heart for ever estranged from the
        faith.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“To the rack! Lift her on to the little horse. Domitius
        Afer left his bequest to the city in order that we should be amused,
        not befooled,”</span> howled the spectators.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“<a name="corr280" id="corr280" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">Executioners</span>,
        do your duty,”</span> said the magistrate. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“But if she cry out, let her off. She will sacrifice.
        Only to the first hole—mind you. If that does not succeed, well,
        then, we shall try sharper means.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And now the little
        horse was set up in the midst of the arena, and braziers of glowing
        charcoal were planted beside it; in the fire rested crooks and
        pincers to get red hot.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“little horse”</span> was a structure of timber. Two
        planks were set edgeways with a wheel between <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page281">[pg 281]</span><a name="Pg281" id="Pg281"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>them at each end. The structure stood on
        four legs, two at each extremity, spreading at the base. Halfway
        down, between these legs, at the ends, was a roller, furnished with
        levers that passed through them. A rope was attached to the ankles,
        another to the wrists of the person extended on the back of the
        <span class="tei tei-q">“horse,”</span> and this rope was strained
        over the pulleys by means of the windlasses. The levers could be
        turned to any extent, so as, if required, to wrench arms and legs
        from their sockets.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And now ensued a
        scene that refuses description. <span class="tei tei-q">“We are made
        a spectacle unto men and angels,”</span> said the apostle, and none
        could realize how true were the words better than those who lived in
        times of persecution. Before that vast concourse the modest Christian
        maiden was despoiled of her raiment and was stretched upon the
        rack—swung between the planks.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Æmilius felt his
        head swim and his heart contract. What could he do? Again he
        entreated, but she shook her head, yet turned at his voice and
        smiled.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then the
        executioners threw themselves on the levers, and a hush as of death
        fell on the multitude. Twenty thousand spectators looked on, twice
        that number of eyes were riveted on the frail girl under<span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page282">[pg 282]</span><a name="Pg282" id="Pg282"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>going this agony. Bets had been made on
        her constancy, bandied about, taken, and booked. Castor stood up,
        with face turned to heaven, and extended arms, praying.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The creaking of
        the windlass was audible; then rang out a sharp cry of pain.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Immediately the
        cords were relaxed and the victim lowered to the ground. Blanda threw
        a mantle over her.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“She will sacrifice,”</span> said Æmilius; <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“take off the cords.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The executioners
        looked to the magistrate. He nodded, and they obeyed. The bonds were
        rapidly removed from her hands and feet.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Blanda, sustain her!”</span> commanded Æmilius, and he
        on one side, with his arm round the sinking, quivering form, and the
        slave-woman on the other, supported Perpetua. Her feet dragged and
        traced a furrow in the sand; they were numbed and powerless through
        the tension of the cords that had been knotted about the ankles.
        Æmilius and Blanda drew her towards the altar.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I cannot! I will not sacrifice! I am a Christian. I
        believe in Christ! I love Christ!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Perpetua,”</span> said Æmilius in agitated tones,
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page283">[pg 283]</span><a name="Pg283"
        id="Pg283" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-q">“your
        happiness and mine depend on compliance. For all I have done for you,
        if you will not for your own sake—consent to this. Here! I will hold
        your hand. Nay, it is I who will strew the incense, and make it
        appear as though it were done by you. Priest! The shell with the
        grains.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Spare me! I cannot!”</span> gasped the girl, struggling
        in his arms. <span class="tei tei-q">“I cannot be false to my
        Christ—for all that He has done for me.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“You shall. I must constrain you.”</span> He set his
        teeth, knitted his brow. All his muscles were set in desperation. He
        strove to force her hand to the altar.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Shame on thee!”</span> sobbed she. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Thou art more cruel than the torturer, more unjust than
        the judge.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was so. Æmilius
        felt that she was right. They did but insult and rack a frail body,
        and he did violence to the soul within.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The people hooted
        and roared, and brandished their arms threateningly. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“We will not be balked! We are being treated to child’s
        play.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Take her back to the rack. Apply the fire,”</span>
        ordered the Quatuorvir.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The executioners
        reclaimed her. She offered no resistance. Æmilius staggered to the
        <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">podium</span></span> and grasped the marble top
        with one hand.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page284">[pg
        284]</span><a name="Pg284" id="Pg284" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She was again
        suspended on the little horse. Again the windlass creaked. The crowd
        listened, held its breath, men looked in each other’s eyes, then back
        to the scene of suffering. Not a sound; not a cry; no, not even a
        sigh. She bore all.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Try fire!”</span> ordered the magistrate.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Æmilius had
        covered his face. He trembled. He would have shut his ears as he did
        his eyes, could he have done so. Verily, the agony of his soul was as
        great as the torture of her body. But there was naught to be heard—an
        ominous stillness, only the groaning of the windlass, and now and
        then a word from one executioner to his fellow.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At every creak of
        the wheel a quiver went through the frame of Æmilius. He listened
        with anguish of mind for a cry. The populace held its breath; it
        waited. There was none. Into her face he dared not look. But the
        twenty thousand spectators stared—and saw naught save lips moving in
        prayer.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And now a mighty
        wonder occurred.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The dense cloud
        that filled the heavens began softly, soundlessly, to discharge its
        burden. First came, scarce noticed, sailing down, a few large white
        flakes like fleeces of wool. Then they came fast, <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page285">[pg 285]</span><a name="Pg285" id="Pg285"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>faster, ever faster. And now it was as
        though a white bridal veil had been let down out of heaven to hide
        from the eyes of the ravening multitude the spectacle of the agony of
        Christ’s martyr. None could see across the arena; soon none could see
        obscurely into it. The snowflakes fell thick and dense, they massed
        as a white cornice on the parapet, they dropped on every head, they
        whitened the bloodstained, trampled sand. And all fled before the
        snow. First went a few in twos or threes; then whole rows stood up,
        and through the vomitories the multitude poured—freedmen, slaves,
        knights, ladies, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
        "la"><span style="font-style: italic">flamines</span></span>,
        magistrates; none could stand against the descending snow.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Cast her down!”</span> This was the last command issued
        by Petronius as he rose from his seat. The executioners were glad to
        escape. They relaxed the ropes, and threw their victim on the already
        white ground.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Still thick and
        fast fell the fleeces. Blanda had cast a mantle of wool over the
        prostrate girl, but out of heaven descended a pall, whiter than
        fuller on earth can bleach, and buried the woolen cloak and the
        extended quivering limbs. Beside her, in the snow, knelt Æmilius. He
        held her hand in one of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page286">[pg
        286]</span><a name="Pg286" id="Pg286" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>his.
        She looked him in the face and smiled. Then she said: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Give to Blanda her liberty.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He could not
        speak. He signed that it should be so.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then she said:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“I have prayed for thee—on the rack, in the
        fire—that the light may shine into thy heart.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She closed her
        eyes.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Still he held her
        hand, and with the other gently brushed away the snowflakes as they
        fell on her pure face. Oh wondrous face! Face above the dream of the
        highest Greek artist!</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus passed an
        hour—thus a second.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then suddenly the
        clouds parted, and the sun poured down a flood of glory over the
        dazzling white oval field, in the midst of which lay a heap of
        whiteness, and on a face as of alabaster, inanimate, and on a
        kneeling, weeping man, still with reverent finger sweeping away the
        last snowflakes from eyelash, cheek and hair, and who felt as if he
        could thus look, and kneel, and weep for ever.<a id="noteref_12"

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Many days had
        passed. All was calm in Nemausus. The games were over.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The day succeeding
        that we have described was warm and spring-like. The sun shone
        brilliantly. Every trace of the snow had disappeared, and the
        water-fight in the amphitheater had surpassed the expectations of the
        people. They had enjoyed themselves heartily.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All had returned
        to its old order. The wool merchant took fresh commands, and sent his
        travelers into the Cebennæ to secure the winter fleeces. The woman
        who had the flower-shop sold garlands as fast as she could weave
        them. The potter spread out a fresh collection of his wares and did a
        good business with them.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The disturbances
        that had taken place were no more spoken about. The deaths of
        Marcianus, Baudillas and Perpetua hardly occupied any thoughts, save
        only those of their relatives and the Christians.</p><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The general public
        had seen a show, and the show over, they had other concerns to occupy
        them.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now both Pedo and
        Blanda were free, and the long tarrying was over. They had loved when
        young, they came together in the autumn of their lives.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the heart of
        the Church of Nemausus there was not forgetfulness of its heroes.</p>

        <div class="tei tei-tb">

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If the visitor at
        the present day to Nîmes will look about him, he will find two
        churches, both recently rebuilt, in place of, and on the site of,
        very ancient places of worship, and the one bears the name of St.
        Baudille. If he inquire of the sacristan, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Mais qui, donc, était-il, ce saint?”</span> then the
        answer given him will be: <span class="tei tei-q">“Baudillas was a
        native of Nîmes, a deacon, and a martyr.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If he ask further,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“But when?”</span> Then the sacristan will
        probably reply with a shrug: <span class="tei tei-q">“Mais, monsieur;
        qui sait?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In another part of
        the town is a second church, glowing internally with color from its
        richly painted windows, and this bears the name of Ste.
        Perpetue.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page289">[pg

        desire to be told whether it has been erected in honor and in
        commemoration of the celebrated African martyrs Felicitas and
        Perpetua, or of some local virgin saint who shed her blood for
        Christ, then let him again inquire of the sacristan.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">What his answer
        will be I cannot say.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Bishop Castor
        remained much in his house. He grieved that he had not been called to
        witness to the faith that was in him. But he was a humble man, and he
        said to himself: <span class="tei tei-q">“Such was the will of God,
        and that sufficeth me.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One evening he was
        informed that a man, who would not give his name, desired to speak
        with him.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He ordered that he
        should be introduced.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the visitor
        entered, Castor recognized Æmilius, but the man was changed. Lines of
        thought and of sorrow marked his face, that bore other impress as
        well of the travail of his soul within him. He seemed older, his face
        more refined than before, there was less of carnal beauty, and
        something spiritual that shone out of his eyes.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The bishop warmly
        welcomed him.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page290">[pg

        in a low tone, <span class="tei tei-q">“I am come to thee for
        instruction. I know but little, yet what I know of Christ I believe.

              Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
              electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
              computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new
              computers. It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of
              volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Volunteers
              and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance
              they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™'s goals
              and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will remain
              freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
              Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a
              secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
              generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Project
              Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread
              public support and donations to carry out its mission of
              increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that
              can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible
              by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment.
              Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important
              to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
              Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
              charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the
              United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it
              takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to
              meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit
              donations in locations where we have not received written
              confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the
              status of compliance for any particular state visit <a href=
              "http://www.gutenberg.org/donate" class=

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While we
              cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
              have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no
              prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors
              in such states who approach us with offers to donate.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
              International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot
              make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations
              received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp
              our small staff.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Please check
              the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods

              Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
